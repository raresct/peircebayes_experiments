In recent years , a variation of the model has become a basic tool in studying problems that arise in revenue management and dynamic/flexible pricing ; and it is in this context that our study is undertaken . Based on a dynamic programming formulation and associated properties of the value function , we study in this paper a class of control that we call switch-over policies -- start from accepting only orders of the highest price , and switch to including lower prices as time goes by , with the switch-over times optimally decided via convex programming . We establish the asymptotic optimality of the switch-over policy , and develop pricing models based on this policy to optimize the price reductions over the decision horizon .
