0710.5497	q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph	Multifractality in the Random Parameters Model	The Random Parameters model was proposed to explain the structure of the covariance matrix in problems where most , but not all , of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix can be explained by Random Matrix Theory . In this article , we explore other properties of the model , like the scaling of its PDF as one take larger scales . Special attention is given to the multifractal structure of the model time series , which revealed a scaling structure compatible with the known stylized facts for a reasonable choice of the parameter values .
