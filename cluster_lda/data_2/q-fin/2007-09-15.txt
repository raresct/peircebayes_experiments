We find that regardless of used data sets , all data exhibits the volatility clustering properties , whereas those which filtered the volatility clustering effect by using the GARCH model reduce volatility clustering significantly . The result confirms that our method can measure the volatility clustering effect in financial market .

Analysis performed on several time series have shown deviation from the Bm hypothesis , that is at the base of the evaluation of many financial derivatives . We inquiry in the behavior of measures of performance based on maximum drawdown movements ( MDD ) , testing their stability when the underlying process deviates from the Bm hypothesis . In particular we consider the fractional Brownian motion ( fBm ) , and fluctuations estimated empirically on raw market data . The case study of the rising part of speculative bubbles is reported .

We use Pajek to identify network structure and behavior across thresholds and over time . In particular , we focus on the evolution of trade `` islands '' in the a world trade network in which countries are linked with directed edges weighted according to fraction of total dollars sent from one country to another . We find mixed evidence for globalization .
