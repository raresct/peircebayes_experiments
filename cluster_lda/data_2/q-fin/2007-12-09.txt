0712.1343	q-fin.CP math.PR	An Hilbert space approach for a class of arbitrage free implied volatilities models	We present an Hilbert space formulation for a set of implied volatility models introduced in \cite { BraceGoldys01 } in which the authors studied conditions for a family of European call options , varying the maturing time and the strike price $ T $ an $ K $ , to be arbitrage free . The arbitrage free conditions give a system of stochastic PDEs for the evolution of the implied volatility surface $ { \hat\sigma } _t ( T , K ) $ . We will focus on the family obtained fixing a strike $ K $ and varying $ T $ . In order to give conditions to prove an existence-and-uniqueness result for the solution of the system it is here expressed in terms of the square root of the forward implied volatility and rewritten in an Hilbert space setting . The existence and the uniqueness for the ( arbitrage free ) evolution of the forward implied volatility , and then of the the implied volatility , among a class of models , are proved . Specific examples are also given .
