A trading algorithm inspired by biological motors , introduced by L. Gil\cite { Gil } , is suggested as a testing ground for anchoring in financial markets . An exact solution of the algorithm is presented for arbitrary price distributions . Furthermore the algorithm is extended to cover the case of a market neutral portfolio , revealing additional evidence that anchoring is involved in the decision making of market participants . The exposure of arbitrage possibilities created by anchoring gives yet another illustration on the difficulty proving market efficiency by only considering lower order correlations in past price time series
