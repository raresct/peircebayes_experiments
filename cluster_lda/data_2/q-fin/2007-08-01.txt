0708.0209	q-fin.TR physics.soc-ph	Models of Financial Markets with Extensive Participation Incentives	We consider models of financial markets in which all parties involved find incentives to participate . Strategies are evaluated directly by their virtual wealths . By tuning the price sensitivity and market impact , a phase diagram with several attractor behaviors resembling those of real markets emerge , reflecting the roles played by the arbitrageurs and trendsetters , and including a phase with irregular price trends and positive sums . The positive-sumness of the players ' wealths provides participation incentives for them . Evolution and the bid-ask spread provide mechanisms for the gain in wealth of both the players and market-makers . New players survive in the market if the evolutionary rate is sufficiently slow . We test the applicability of the model on real Hang Seng Index data over 20 years . Comparisons with other models show that our model has a superior average performance when applied to real financial data .
