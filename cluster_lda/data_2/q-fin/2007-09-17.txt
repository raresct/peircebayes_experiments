The abstract model that is developed is easily adapted to any particular field . In any interacting environment , the agents receive something from the environment ( the other agents ) in exchange for their effort and pay the environment a certain amount of value for the fulfilling of their needs or for the very price of existence in that environment . This is coded by two bit strings and the dynamics of the exchange is based on the matching of these strings to those of the other agents . Innovation is related to the adaptation by the agents of their bit strings to improve some utility function .
