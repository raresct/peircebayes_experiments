0708.1715	q-fin.PM math.PR	On the structure of general mean-variance hedging strategies	We provide a new characterization of mean-variance hedging strategies in a general semimartingale market . The key point is the introduction of a new probability measure $ P^ { \star } $ which turns the dynamic asset allocation problem into a myopic one . The minimal martingale measure relative to $ P^ { \star } $ coincides with the variance-optimal martingale measure relative to the original probability measure $ P $ .
0708.1756	q-fin.TR math.PR	Optimal execution strategies in limit order books with general shape functions	We consider optimal execution strategies for block market orders placed in a limit order book ( LOB ) . We build on the resilience model proposed by Obizhaeva and Wang ( 2005 ) but allow for a general shape of the LOB defined via a given density function . Thus , we can allow for empirically observed LOB shapes and obtain a nonlinear price impact of market orders . We distinguish two possibilities for modeling the resilience of the LOB after a large market order : the exponential recovery of the number of limit orders , i.e. , of the volume of the LOB , or the exponential recovery of the bid-ask spread . We consider both of these resilience modes and , in each case , derive explicit optimal execution strategies in discrete time . Applying our results to a block-shaped LOB , we obtain a new closed-form representation for the optimal strategy , which explicitly solves the recursive scheme given in Obizhaeva and Wang ( 2005 ) . We also provide some evidence for the robustness of optimal strategies with respect to the choice of the shape function and the resilience-type .
