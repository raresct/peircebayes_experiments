The analysis consists about quantification of dependence and non-Gaussianity on the multifractal character of financial quantities . Our results point out an equivalent influence of dependence and non-Gaussianity on the multifractality of time series . Moreover , we analyse l-diagrams of price fluctuations . In the latter case , we show that the fractal dimension of these maps is basically independent of the lag between price fluctuations that we assume .

Our approach is very natural to the issue because it is based in the use of renewal equations , and therefore it enhances the potential use of CTRW techniques in finance . We solve these equations for typical contract specifications , in a particular but exemplifying case . We also show how a formal general solution can be found for more exotic derivatives , and we compare prices for alternative models of the underlying . Finally , we recover the celebrated results for the Wiener process under certain limits .
