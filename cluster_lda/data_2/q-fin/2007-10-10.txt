For the period 1999-2004 on average for all countries in the world , we find that an increase of CPI by one unit leads to an increase of the annual GDP per capita by 1.7 % . By regressing only European transition countries , we find that $ \Delta $ CPI = 1 generates increase of the annual GDP per capita by 2.4 % . We also analyze the relation between foreign direct investments received by different countries and CPI , and we find a statistically significant power-law functional dependence between foreign direct investment per capita and the country corruption level measured by the CPI . We introduce a new measure to quantify the relative corruption between countries based on their respective wealth as measured by GDP per capita .
