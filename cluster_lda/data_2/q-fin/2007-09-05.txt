0709.0591	q-fin.ST physics.data-an	Utility function estimation : the entropy approach	The maximum entropy principle can be used to assign utility values when only partial information is available about the decision maker 's preferences . In order to obtain such utility values it is necessary to establish an analogy between probability and utility through the notion of a utility density function . According to some authors [ Soofi ( 1990 ) , Abbas ( 2006a ) ( 2006b ) , Sandow et al . ( 2006 ) , Friedman and Sandow ( 2006 ) , Darooneh ( 2006 ) ] the maximum entropy utility solution embeds a large family of utility functions . In this paper we explore the maximum entropy principle to estimate the utility function of a risk averse decision maker .

One of the most popular concepts used to measure the risk and the uncertainty is the variance and/or the standard-deviation . In this paper we explore the following issues : Is the standard-deviation a good measure of risk and uncertainty ? What are the potentialities of the entropy in this context ? Can entropy present some advantages as a measure of uncertainty and simultaneously verify some basic assumptions of the portfolio management theory , namely the effect of diversification ?
