0707.2284	q-fin.ST physics.data-an physics.soc-ph	Nonlinear behavior of the Chinese SSEC index with a unit root : Evidence from threshold unit root tests	We investigate the behavior of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite ( SSEC ) index for the period from 1990:12 to 2007:06 using an unconstrained two-regime threshold autoregressive ( TAR ) model with an unit root developed by Caner and Hansen . The method allows us to simultaneously consider non-stationarity and nonlinearity in financial time series . Our finding indicates that the Shanghai stock market exhibits nonlinear behavior with two regimes and has unit roots in both regimes . The important implications of the threshold effect in stock markets are also discussed .

In this study , we present a computational model of a cultural market and we aim to analyze the behavior of the consumer population as an emergent phenomena . Our results suggest that the final market shares of cultural products dramatically depend on consumer heterogeneity and social interaction pressure . Furthermore , the relation between the resulting market shares and social interaction is robust with respect to a wide range of variation in the parameter values and the type of topology .
