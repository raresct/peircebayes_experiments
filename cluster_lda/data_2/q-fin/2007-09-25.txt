When multiple co-evolving data streams are observed , an important task is to determine how these streams depend on each other , accounting for dynamic dependence patterns without imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence . In this paper we argue that flexible least squares ( FLS ) , a penalized version of ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression coefficients , can be deployed successfully in this context . Our motivating application is statistical arbitrage , an investment strategy that exploits patterns detected in financial data streams . We demonstrate that FLS is algebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations , and take advantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest a more efficient algorithm . Promising experimental results obtained from a FLS-based algorithmic trading system for the S & P 500 Futures Index are reported .
