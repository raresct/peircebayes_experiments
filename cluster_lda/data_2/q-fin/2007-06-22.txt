0706.3331	q-fin.RM math.PR	A Model for Counterparty Risk with Geometric Attenuation Effect and the Valuation of CDS	In this paper , a geometric function is introduced to reflect the attenuation speed of impact of one firm 's default to its partner . If two firms are competitions ( copartners ) , the default intensity of one firm will decrease ( increase ) abruptly when the other firm defaults . As time goes on , the impact will decrease gradually until extinct . In this model , the joint distribution and marginal distributions of default times are derived by employing the change of measure , so can we value the fair swap premium of a CDS .
