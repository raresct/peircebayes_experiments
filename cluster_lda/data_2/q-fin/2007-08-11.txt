0708.1568	q-fin.PR math.AP math.GR	Nonlinear option pricing models for illiquid markets : scaling properties and explicit solutions	Several models for the pricing of derivative securities in illiquid markets are discussed . A typical type of nonlinear partial differential equations arising from these investigation is studied . The scaling properties of these equations are discussed . Explicit solutions for one of the models are obtained and studied .
