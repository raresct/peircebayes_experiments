We calculate exponential utility-based indifference prices , and corresponding derivative hedges . We use the fact that they can be represented in terms of solutions of forward-backward stochastic differential equations ( FBSDE ) with quadratic growth generators . We derive the Markov property of such FBSDE and generalize results on the differentiability relative to the initial value of their forward components . In this case the optimal hedge can be represented by the price gradient multiplied with the correlation coefficient . This way we obtain a generalization of the classical 'delta hedge ' in complete markets .
