The model is based on a jump -- diffusion process for the risk factors , i.e . for the company assets . We also include correlations between the companies . We discuss that models of this type have much in common with other problems in statistical physics and in the theory of complex systems . We study a simplified version of our model analytically . Furthermore , we perform extensive numerical simulations for the full model . The observables are the loss distribution of the credit portfolio , its moments and other quantities derived thereof . We compile detailed information about the parameter dependence of these observables . In the course of setting up and analyzing our model , we also give a review of credit risk modeling for a physics audience .

Unfortunately , discounted cash flow , method of comparables , and fundamental analysis typically yield discrepant valuation estimates . Moreover , the valuation estimates typically disagree with market price . Can one form a superior valuation estimate by averaging over the individual estimates , including market price ? This article suggests a Bayesian framework for combining two or more estimates into a superior valuation estimate . The framework justifies the common practice of averaging over several estimates to arrive at a final point estimate .
