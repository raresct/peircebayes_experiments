The dynamics of the investor 's budget , $ x ( t ) $ , depends on the stochasticity of the return on investment , $ r ( t ) $ , for which different model assumptions are discussed . The fat-tail distribution of the budget is investigated and compared with theoretical predictions . Weare mainly interested in the most probable value $ x_mp $ of the budget that reaches a constant value over time . Based on an analytical investigation of the dynamics , we are able to predict $ x_mp^stat $ . We find a scaling law that relates the most probable value to the characteristic parameters describing the stochastic process . Our analytical results are confirmed by stochastic computer simulations that show a very good agreement with the predictions .
