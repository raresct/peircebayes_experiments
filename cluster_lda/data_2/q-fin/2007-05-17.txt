Economic systems with power law distribution in the wealth is one of the examples . To better understand the working behind the complexity , we undertook an empirical study measuring the interactions between market participants . A Web server was setup to administer the exchange of futures contracts whose liquidation prices were coupled to event outcomes . After free registration , participants started trading to compete for the money prizes upon maturity of the futures contracts at the end of the experiment . The evolving `cash ' flow network was reconstructed from the transactions between players . We show that the network topology is hierarchical , disassortative and scale-free with a power law exponent of 1.02+-0.09 in the degree distribution . The small-world property emerged early in the experiment while the number of participants was still small . We also show power law distributions of the net incomes and inter-transaction time intervals . Big winners and losers are associated with high degree , high betweenness centrality , low clustering coefficient and low degree-correlation . We identify communities in the network as groups of the like-minded . The distribution of the community sizes is shown to be power-law distributed with an exponent of 1.19+-0.16 .
