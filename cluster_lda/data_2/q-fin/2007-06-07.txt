0706.1028	q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph	Hiking the hypercube : producers and consumers	We study the dynamics of co-evolution of producers and customers described by bit-strings representing individual traits . Individual ''size-like '' properties are controlled by binary encounters which outcome depends upon a recognition process . Depending upon the parameter set-up , mutual selection of producers and customers results in different types of attractors , either an exclusive niches regime or a competition regime .
