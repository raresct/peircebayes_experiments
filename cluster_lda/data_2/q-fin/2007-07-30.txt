0707.4343	q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph	The International Trade Network : weighted network analysis and modelling	Tools of the theory of critical phenomena , namely the scaling analysis and universality , are argued to be applicable to large complex web-like network structures . Using a detailed analysis of the real data of the International Trade Network we argue that the scaled link weight distribution has an approximate log-normal distribution which remains robust over a period of 53 years . Another universal feature is observed in the power-law growth of the trade strength with gross domestic product , the exponent being similar for all countries . Using the 'rich-club ' coefficient measure of the weighted networks it has been shown that the size of the rich-club controlling half of the world 's trade is actually shrinking . While the gravity law is known to describe well the social interactions in the static networks of population migration , international trade , etc , here for the first time we studied a non-conservative dynamical model based on the gravity law which excellently reproduced many empirical features of the ITN .
0707.4347	q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph	The International Trade Network	Bilateral trade relationships in the international level between pairs of countries in the world give rise to the notion of the International Trade Network ( ITN ) . This network has attracted the attention of network researchers as it serves as an excellent example of the weighted networks , the link weight being defined as a measure of the volume of trade between two countries . In this paper we analyzed the international trade data for 53 years and studied in detail the variations of different network related quantities associated with the ITN . Our observation is that the ITN has also a scale invariant structure like many other real-world networks .
