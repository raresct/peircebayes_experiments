This issue has also been addressed from a dynamical systems perspective , with especial emphasis on the concept of the Balanced Scorecard . Our study enables us to make the general claim that although the fortunes of an industrial organization can rise with exponential rapidity on relatively short time scales , its growth will ultimately and inevitably be saturated on long time scales by various factors which are nonlinear in character . We have mathematically demonstrated the likely occurrence of this feature under various possible circumstances , including the Red Ocean and the Blue Ocean . Finally and most importantly , our arguments and their associated mathematical modelling have received remarkable support from the growth pattern indicated by empirical data gathered from a well-recognized global company like IBM .

We find that the returns at the one-trade timescale obey the inverse cubic law . For larger timescales ( 2-32 trades and 1-5 minutes ) , the returns follow the Student distribution with power-law tails . With the decrease of timescale , the tail becomes fatter , which is consistent with the vibrational theory .
