This family includes hybrid models with stochastic volatility , stochastic interest-rates , jumps and their non-hybrid counterparts . The methodology is applied to Heston's model . A bootstrapping algorithm is presented for calibration . A case study works out the calibration of the time-dependent parameters to the volatility surface of the Eurostoxx 50 index . The methodology is also applied to the analytic valuation of forward start vanilla options driven by Heston 's model . This result is used to explore the forward skew of the case study .

The technology , capital , institutions and skills needed to make such new products are more easily adapted from some products than others . We study the network of relatedness between products , or product space , finding that most upscale products are located in a densely connected core while lower income products occupy a less connected periphery . We show that countries tend to move to goods close to those they are currently specialized in , allowing nations located in more connected parts of the product space to upgrade their exports basket more quickly . Most countries can reach the core only if they jump over empirically infrequent distances in the product space . This may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports , failing to converge to the income levels of rich countries .
