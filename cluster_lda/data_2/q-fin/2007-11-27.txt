0711.4225	q-fin.GN math.OC	Consumption processes and positively homogeneous projection properties	We constructively prove the existence of time-discrete consumption processes for stochastic money accounts that fulfill a pre-specified positively homogeneous projection property ( PHPP ) and let the account always be positive and exactly zero at the end . One possible example is consumption rates forming a martingale under the above restrictions . For finite spaces , it is shown that any strictly positive consumption strategy with restrictions as above possesses at least one corresponding PHPP and could be constructed from it . We also consider numeric examples under time-discrete and -continuous account processes , cases with infinite time horizons and applications to income drawdown and bonus theory .
