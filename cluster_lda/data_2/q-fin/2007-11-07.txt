It is a combination of the utility indifference pricing and optimal intertemporal risk allocation . We give a characterization of the optimal intertemporal risk allocation by a first order condition . Applying this result to the exponential utility function , we obtain an essentially new type of premium calculation method for a popular type of multi-period insurance contract . This method is simple and can be easily implemented numerically . We see that the results of numerical calculations are well coincident with the risk loading level determined by traditional practices . The results also suggest a possible implied utility approach to insurance pricing .
