An incorrect assumption of stationary increments generates spurious stylized facts , fat tails and a Hurst exponent H_s=1/2 , when the increments are nonstationary , as they are in FX markets . The nonstationarity arises from systematic uneveness in noise traders ' behavior . Spurious results arise mathematically from using a log increment with a 'sliding window ' . We explain why a hard to beat market demands martingale dynamics , and martingales with nonlinear variance generate nonstationary increments . The nonstationarity is exhibited directly for Euro/Dollar FX data . We observe that the Hurst exponent H_s generated by the using the sliding window technique on a time series plays the same role as does Mandelbrot's Joseph exponent . Finally , Mandelbrot originally assumed that the 'badly behaved ' second moment of cotton returns is due to fat tails , but that nonconvergent behavior is instead direct evidence for nonstationary increments . Summarizing , the evidence for scaling and fat tails as the basis for econophysics and financial economics is provided neither by FX markets nor by cotton price data .
