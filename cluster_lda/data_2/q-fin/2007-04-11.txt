0704.1348	q-fin.RM math.PR	Large portfolio losses : A dynamic contagion model	Using particle system methodologies we study the propagation of financial distress in a network of firms facing credit risk . We investigate the phenomenon of a credit crisis and quantify the losses that a bank may suffer in a large credit portfolio . Applying a large deviation principle we compute the limiting distributions of the system and determine the time evolution of the credit quality indicators of the firms , deriving moreover the dynamics of a global financial health indicator . We finally describe a suitable version of the `` Central Limit Theorem '' useful to study large portfolio losses . Simulation results are provided as well as applications to portfolio loss distribution analysis .
0704.1433	q-fin.CP math.PR	Exact retrospective Monte Carlo computation of arithmetic average Asian options	Taking advantage of the recent litterature on exact simulation algorithms ( Beskos , Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts ) and unbiased estimation of the expectation of certain fonctional integrals ( Wagner , Beskos et al . and Fearnhead et al . ) , we apply an exact simulation based technique for pricing continuous arithmetic average Asian options in the Black and Scholes framework . Unlike existing Monte Carlo methods , we are no longer prone to the discretization bias resulting from the approximation of continuous time processes through discrete sampling . Numerical results of simulation studies are presented and variance reduction problems are considered .
