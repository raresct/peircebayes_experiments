Understanding the relation between local and global features calls for analytical tools able to uncover the global emerging organization of the international trade network . Here we analyze the world network of bilateral trade imbalances and characterize its overall flux organization , unraveling local and global high-flux pathways that define the backbone of the trade system . We develop a general procedure capable to progressively filter out in a consistent and quantitative way the dominant trade channels . This procedure is completely general and can be applied to any weighted network to detect the underlying structure of transport flows . The trade fluxes properties of the world trade web determines a ranking of trade partnerships that highlights global interdependencies , providing information not accessible by simple local analysis . The present work provides new quantitative tools for a dynamical approach to the propagation of economic crises .
0704.1338	q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph	True and Apparent Scaling : The Proximity of the Markov-Switching Multifractal Model to Long-Range Dependence	In this paper , we consider daily financial data of a collection of different stock market indices , exchange rates , and interest rates , and we analyze their multi-scaling properties by estimating a simple specification of the Markov-switching multifractal model ( MSM ) . In order to see how well the estimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data , we estimate and compare the scaling exponents $ H ( q ) $ ( for $ q = 1 , 2 $ ) for both empirical data and simulated data of the estimated MSM models . In most cases the multifractal model appears to generate `apparent ' long memory in agreement with the empirical scaling laws .
