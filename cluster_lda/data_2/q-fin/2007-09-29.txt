In this way various types of barrier options are priced , including barrier options paying rebates , and options on dividend-paying-stocks . Moreover , the barriers may be monitored either continuously or discretely . In addition to the high-order accuracy of the scheme , and the stretching effect of the coordinate transformation , the main feature of this approach lies on a probability-based optimal determination of boundary conditions . This leads to much faster and accurate results when compared with similar pricing approaches . The strength of the present scheme is particularly demonstrated in the valuation of discretely monitored barrier options where it yields values closest to those obtained from the only semi-analytical valuation method available .
