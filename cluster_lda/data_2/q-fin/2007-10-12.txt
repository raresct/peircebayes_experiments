The daily periodicity in the spread time series is confirmed by Lomb analysis and the intraday bid-ask spreads are found to exhibit $ L $ -shaped pattern with idiosyncratic fine structure . The intraday spread of individual stocks relaxes as a power law within the first hour of the continuous double auction from 9:30AM to 10:30AM with exponents $ \beta_ { \rm { SHSE } } =0.19\pm0.069 $ for the Shanghai market and $ \beta_ { \rm { SZSE } } =0.18\pm0.067 $ for the Shenzhen market . The power-law relaxation exponent $ \beta $ of individual stocks is roughly normally distributed . There is evidence showing that the accumulation of information widening the spread is an endogenous process .
