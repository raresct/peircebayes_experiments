Such Least Squares Importance Sampling ( LSIS ) allows the automatic optimization of the sampling distribution within a trial class by means of a quick presimulation algorithm of straightforward implementation . With several numerical examples we show that LSIS can be extremely effective in reducing the variance of Monte Carlo estimators often resulting , especially when combined with stratified sampling , in computational speed-ups of orders of magnitude .
