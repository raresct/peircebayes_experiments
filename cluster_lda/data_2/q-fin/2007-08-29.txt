0708.4022	q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph q-fin.CP	Time reversal invariance in finance	Time reversal invariance can be summarized as follows : no difference can be measured if a sequence of events is run forward or backward in time . Because price time series are dominated by a randomness that hides possible structures and orders , the existence of time reversal invariance requires care to be investigated . Different statistics are constructed with the property to be zero for time series which are time reversal invariant ; they all show that high-frequency empirical foreign exchange prices are not invariant . The same statistics are applied to mathematical processes that should mimic empirical prices . Monte Carlo simulations show that only some ARCH processes with a multi-timescales structure can reproduce the empirical findings . A GARCH ( 1,1 ) process can only reproduce some asymmetry . On the other hand , all the stochastic volatility type processes are time reversal invariant . This clear difference related to the process structures gives some strong selection criterion for processes .
