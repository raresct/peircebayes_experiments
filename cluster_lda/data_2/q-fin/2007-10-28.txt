0710.5301	q-fin.CP math.NA	An iterative algorithm for evaluating approximations to the optimal exercise boundary for a nonlinear Black-Scholes equation	The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compute the early exercise boundary for a class of nonlinear Black -- Scholes equations with a nonlinear volatility which can be a function of the second derivative of the option price itself . A motivation for studying the nonlinear Black -- Scholes equation with a nonlinear volatility arises from option pricing models taking into account e.g . nontrivial transaction costs , investor 's preferences , feedback and illiquid markets effects and risk from a volatile ( unprotected ) portfolio . We present a new method how to transform the free boundary problem for the early exercise boundary position into a solution of a time depending nonlinear parabolic equation defined on a fixed domain . We furthermore propose an iterative numerical scheme that can be used to find an approximation of the free boundary . We present results of numerical approximation of the early exercise boundary for various types of nonlinear Black -- Scholes equations and we discuss dependence of the free boundary on various model parameters .
