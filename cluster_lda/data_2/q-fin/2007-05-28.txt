We use data from the limit order book of the London Stock Exchange ( LSE ) to compare how the fluctuation dominated microstructure crosses over to a more systematic global behavior .
0705.4025	q-fin.TR physics.soc-ph	Stochastic analysis of an agent-based model	We analyze the dynamics of a forecasting game which exhibits the phenomenon of information cascades . Each agent aims at correctly predicting a binary variable and he/she can either look for independent information or herd on the choice of others . We show that dynamics can be analitically described in terms of a Langevin equation and its collective behavior is described by the solution of a Kramers ' problem . This provides very accurate results in the region where the vast majority of agents herd , which corresponds to the most interesting one from a game theoretic point of view .
