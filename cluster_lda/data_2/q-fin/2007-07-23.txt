In particular , by using the concept of `` local '' Hurst exponent , we point out how the behaviour of this parameter , usually considered as a benchmark for persistency/antipersistency recognition in time series , is largely time-scale dependent in the market context . These findings are a direct consequence of the intrinsic complexity of a system where trading strategies are scale-adaptive . Moreover , our analysis points out different regimes in the dynamical behaviour of the market indices under consideration .
