0707.1897	q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph	Maximum Entropy , the Collective Welfare Principle and the Globalization Process	Although both systems analyzed are described through two theories apparently different ( quantum mechanics and game theory ) it is shown that both are analogous and thus exactly equivalents . The quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is the von Neumann equation . Quantum mechanics could be used to explain more correctly biological and economical processes . It could even encloses theories like games and evolutionary dynamics . We can take some concepts and definitions from quantum mechanics and physics for the best understanding of the behavior of economics and biology . Also , we could maybe understand nature like a game in where its players compete for a common welfare and the equilibrium of the system that they are members . All the members of our system will play a game in which its maximum payoff is the equilibrium of the system . They act as a whole besides individuals like they obey a rule in where they prefer to work for the welfare of the collective besides the individual welfare . A system where its members are in Nash Equilibrium ( or ESS ) is exactly equivalent to a system in a maximum entropy state . A system is stable only if it maximizes the welfare of the collective above the welfare of the individual . If it is maximized the welfare of the individual above the welfare of the collective the system gets unstable an eventually collapses . The results of this work shows that the `` globalization '' process has a behavior exactly equivalent to a system that is tending to a maximum entropy state and predicts the apparition of big common markets and strong common currencies that will find its `` equilibrium '' by decreasing its number until they get a state characterized by only one common currency and only one common market around the world .
