0707.4638	q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph	Indication of multiscaling in the volatility return intervals of stock markets	The distribution of the return intervals $ \tau $ between volatilities above a threshold $ q $ for financial records has been approximated by a scaling behavior . To explore how accurate is the scaling and therefore understand the underlined non-linear mechanism , we investigate intraday datasets of 500 stocks which consist of the Standard & Poor 's 500 index . We show that the cumulative distribution of return intervals has systematic deviations from scaling . We support this finding by studying the m-th moment $ \mu_m \equiv < ( \tau/ < \tau > ) ^m > ^ { 1/m } $ , which show a certain trend with the mean interval $ < \tau > $ . We generate surrogate records using the Schreiber method , and find that their cumulative distributions almost collapse to a single curve and moments are almost constant for most range of $ < \tau > $ . Those substantial differences suggest that non-linear correlations in the original volatility sequence account for the deviations from a single scaling law . We also find that the original and surrogate records exhibit slight tendencies for short and long $ < \tau > $ , due to the discreteness and finite size effects of the records respectively . To avoid as possible those effects for testing the multiscaling behavior , we investigate the moments in the range $ 10 < < \tau > \leq100 $ , and find the exponent $ \alpha $ from the power law fitting $ \mu_m\sim < \tau > ^\alpha $ has a narrow distribution around $ \alpha\neq0 $ which depend on m for the 500 stocks . The distribution of $ \alpha $ for the surrogate records are very narrow and centered around $ \alpha=0 $ . This suggests that the return interval distribution exhibit multiscaling behavior due to the non-linear correlations in the original volatility .
0708.0046	q-fin.PM math.FA stat.AP	Sparse and stable Markowitz portfolios	We consider the problem of portfolio selection within the classical Markowitz mean-variance framework , reformulated as a constrained least-squares regression problem . We propose to add to the objective function a penalty proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the portfolio weights . This penalty regularizes ( stabilizes ) the optimization problem , encourages sparse portfolios ( i.e . portfolios with only few active positions ) , and allows to account for transaction costs . Our approach recovers as special cases the no-short-positions portfolios , but does allow for short positions in limited number . We implement this methodology on two benchmark data sets constructed by Fama and French . Using only a modest amount of training data , we construct portfolios whose out-of-sample performance , as measured by Sharpe ratio , is consistently and significantly better than that of the naive evenly-weighted portfolio which constitutes , as shown in recent literature , a very tough benchmark .
0708.0063	q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph	Information flow between composite stock index and individual stocks	We investigate the strength and the direction of information transfer in the U.S. stock market between the composite stock price index of stock market and prices of individual stocks using the transfer entropy . Through the directionality of the information transfer , we find that individual stocks are influenced by the index of the market .
