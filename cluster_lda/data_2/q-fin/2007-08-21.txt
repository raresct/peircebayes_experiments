The investors are arranged on the well known scale-free type network , the Barab\ ' { a } si-Albert model . Each investor is supposed to preferentially distribute capital to pools in its portfolio based on the knowledge of pool sizes . The extent that investors prefer larger pools is determined by investment strategy denoted by a tunable parameter $ \alpha $ , with larger $ \alpha $ corresponding to more preference to larger pools . As comparison , we also study this interaction model on square lattice , and find that the heterogeneity contacts favors cooperation . Additionally , the influence of local topology to the game dynamics under different $ \alpha $ strategies are discussed . It is found that the system with smaller $ \alpha $ strategy can perform comparatively better than the larger $ \alpha $ ones .
