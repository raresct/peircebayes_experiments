0706.3122	q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph	Effects of payoff functions and preference distributions in an adaptive population	Adaptive populations such as those in financial markets and distributed control can be modeled by the Minority Game . We consider how their dynamics depends on the agents ' initial preferences of strategies , when the agents use linear or quadratic payoff functions to evaluate their strategies . We find that the fluctuations of the population making certain decisions ( the volatility ) depends on the diversity of the distribution of the initial preferences of strategies . When the diversity decreases , more agents tend to adapt their strategies together . In systems with linear payoffs , this results in dynamical transitions from vanishing volatility to a non-vanishing one . For low signal dimensions , the dynamical transitions for the different signals do not take place at the same critical diversity . Rather , a cascade of dynamical transitions takes place when the diversity is reduced . In contrast , no phase transitions are found in systems with the quadratic payoffs . Instead , a basin boundary of attraction separates two groups of samples in the space of the agents ' decisions . Initial states inside this boundary converge to small volatility , while those outside diverge to a large one . Furthermore , when the preference distribution becomes more polarized , the dynamics becomes more erratic . All the above results are supported by good agreement between simulations and theory .
