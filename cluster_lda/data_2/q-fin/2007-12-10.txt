0712.1483	q-fin.TR math.PR	Continuous-time trading and emergence of volatility	This note continues investigation of randomness-type properties emerging in idealized financial markets with continuous price processes . It is shown , without making any probabilistic assumptions , that the strong variation exponent of non-constant price processes has to be 2 , as in the case of continuous martingales .
0712.1624	q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph	Hurst exponent and prediction based on weak-form efficient market hypothesis of stock markets	We empirically investigated the relationships between the degree of efficiency and the predictability in financial time-series data . The Hurst exponent was used as the measurement of the degree of efficiency , and the hit rate calculated from the nearest-neighbor prediction method was used for the prediction of the directions of future price changes . We used 60 market indexes of various countries . We empirically discovered that the relationship between the degree of efficiency ( the Hurst exponent ) and the predictability ( the hit rate ) is strongly positive . That is , a market index with a higher Hurst exponent tends to have a higher hit rate . These results suggested that the Hurst exponent is useful for predicting future price changes . Furthermore , we also discovered that the Hurst exponent and the hit rate are useful as standards that can distinguish emerging capital markets from mature capital markets .
