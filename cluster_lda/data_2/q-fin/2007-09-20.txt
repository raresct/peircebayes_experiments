The collection of strategies associated with a member institution is defined by the sequence of signs of net volume traded by that institution in hour intervals . Using several methods we show that there are significant and persistent correlations between institutions . In addition , the correlations are structured into correlated and anti-correlated groups . Clustering techniques using the correlations as a distance metric reveal a meaningful clustering structure with two groups of institutions trading in opposite directions .
