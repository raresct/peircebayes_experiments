The household receives a wage income continuously , which is terminated by unexpected ( premature ) loss of earning power or ( planned and intended ) retirement , whichever happens first . In order to hedge the risk of losing income stream by householder 's unpredictable event , the household enters a life insurance contract by paying a premium to an insurance company . The household may also invest their wealth into a financial market . The problem is to determine an optimal insurance/investment/consumption strategy in order to maximize the expected total , discounted utility from consumption and terminal wealth . To reflect a real-life situation better , we consider an incomplete market where the householder can not trade insurance contracts continuously . To our best knowledge , such a model is new in the insurance and finance literature . The case of exponential utilities is considered in detail to derive an explicit solution . We also provide numerical experiments for that particular case to illustrate our results .
