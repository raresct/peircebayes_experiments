Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter have argued that while evolutionary thinking was prevalent in prewar economics , the postwar Neoclassical school became almost entirely preoccupied with equilibrium conditions and their mathematical conditions . One of the problems with the economic interpretation of firm selection through competition has been a weak grasp on an incomplete scientific paradigm . As I.F . Price notes , `` The biological metaphor has long lurked in the background of management theory largely because the message of 'survival of the fittest ' ( usually wrongly attributed to Charles Darwin rather than Herbert Spencer ) provides a seemingly natural model for market competition ( e.g . Alchian 1950 , Merrell 1984 , Henderson 1989 , Moore 1993 ) , without seriously challenging the underlying paradigms of what an organisation is . '' In this paper we examine the application of dynamic fitness landscape models to economic theory , particularly the theory of technology substitution , drawing on recent work by Kauffman , Arthur , McKelvey , Nelson and Winter , and Windrum and Birchenhall . In particular we use Professor Post 's early work with John Holland on the genetic algorithm to explain some of the key differences between static and dynamic approaches to economic modeling .
