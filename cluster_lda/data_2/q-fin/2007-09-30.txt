Among them are those directly connected with their activity on markets but one can not neglect other aspects that influence human decisions and their performance as investors . Distinguishing all subgames is usually beyond hope and resource consuming . In this paper we study how investors facing many different games , gather information and form their decision despite being unaware of the complete structure of the game . To this end we apply reinforcement learning methods to the Information Theory Model of Markets ( ITMM ) . Following Mengel , we can try to distinguish a class $ \Gamma $ of games and possible actions ( strategies ) $ a^ { i } _ { m_ { i } } $ for $ i- $ th agent . Any agent divides the whole class of games into analogy subclasses she/he thinks are analogous and therefore adopts the same strategy for a given subclass . The criteria for partitioning are based on profit and costs analysis . The analogy classes and strategies are updated at various stages through the process of learning . This line of research can be continued in various directions .
