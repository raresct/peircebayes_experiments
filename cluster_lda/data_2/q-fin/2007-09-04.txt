0709.0440	q-fin.ST math.ST stat.TH	Are volatility estimators robust with respect to modeling assumptions ?	We consider microstructure as an arbitrary contamination of the underlying latent securities price , through a Markov kernel $ Q $ . Special cases include additive error , rounding and combinations thereof . Our main result is that , subject to smoothness conditions , the two scales realized volatility is robust to the form of contamination $ Q $ . To push the limits of our result , we show what happens for some models that involve rounding ( which is not , of course , smooth ) and see in this situation how the robustness deteriorates with decreasing smoothness . Our conclusion is that under reasonable smoothness , one does not need to consider too closely how the microstructure is formed , while if severe non-smoothness is suspected , one needs to pay attention to the precise structure and also the use to which the estimator of volatility will be put .
