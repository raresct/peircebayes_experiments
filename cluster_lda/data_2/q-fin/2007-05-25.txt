We assume that this process is correlated with a tradable financial asset . We derive optimal strategies for exponential utility from terminal wealth , determine the indifference prices of the derivatives , and interpret them in terms of diversification pressure . Moreover we check the optimal investment strategies for standard admissibility criteria . Finally we compare the static risk connected with an insurance derivative to the reduced risk due to a dynamic investment into the correlated asset . We show that dynamic hedging reduces the risk aversion in terms of entropic risk measures by a factor related to the correlation .
