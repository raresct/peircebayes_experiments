We use two different analytical approaches , as well as numerical simulations , to study the case where the number of agents is fixed and finite ( but large ) , and the rich-get-richer mechanism is invoked a fraction r of the time ( the remainder of the time wealth is disbursed by a homogeneous process ) . At short times , we recover the Pareto law observed for an unbounded number of agents . In later times , the ( moving ) distribution can be scaled to reveal a phase transition with a Gaussian asymptotic form for r < 1/2 and a Pareto-like tail ( on the positive side ) and a novel stretched exponential decay ( on the negative side ) for r > 1/2 .
