0710.0241	q-fin.PR math.OC	Adapted Downhill Simplex Method for Pricing Convertible Bonds	The paper is devoted to modeling optimal exercise strategies of the behavior of investors and issuers working with convertible bonds . This implies solution of the problems of stock price modeling , payoff computation and min-max optimization . Stock prices ( underlying asset ) were modeled under the assumption of the geometric Brownian motion of their values . The Monte Carlo method was used for calculating the real payoff which is the objective function . The min-max optimization problem was solved using the derivative-free Downhill Simplex method . The performed numerical experiments allowed to formulate recommendations for the choice of appropriate size of the initial simplex in the Downhill Simplex Method , the number of generated trajectories of underlying asset , the size of the problem and initial trajectories of the behavior of investors and issuers .
