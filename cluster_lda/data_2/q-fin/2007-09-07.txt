In this work we focus on the multifractal properties found in price and index signals . Although the usual Minority Game ( MG ) models do not exhibit multifractality , we study here one of its variants that does . We show that the nonsynchronous MG models in the nonergodic phase is multifractal and in this sense , together with other stylized facts , constitute a better modeling tool . Using the Structure Function ( SF ) approach we detected the stationary and the scaling range of the time series generated by the MG model and , from the linear ( nonlinear ) behavior of the SF we identified the fractal ( multifractal ) regimes . Finally , using the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima ( WTMM ) technique we obtained its multifractal spectrum width for different dynamical regimes .

The model includes a ` social\rq local field which contains the magnetization at time $ t $ . The nearest neighbour quenched interactions are drawn from a binary distribution which is a function of the bond concentration , $ p $ . The decay of the persistence probability in the model depends on both the spatial dimension and $ p $ . We find no evidence of ` blocking\rq in this model . We also discuss the implications of our results for possible applications in the social and economic fields . It is suggested that the absence , or otherwise , of blocking could be used as a criterion to decide on the validity of a given model in different scenarios .
