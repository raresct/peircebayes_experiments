0705.2097	q-fin.PM physics.data-an physics.soc-ph	A simple algorithm based on fluctuations to play the market	In Biology , all motor enzymes operate on the same principle : they trap favourable brownian fluctuations in order to generate directed forces and to move . Whether it is possible or not to copy one such strategy to play the market was the starting point of our investigations . We found the answer is yes . In this paper we describe one such strategy and appraise its performance with historical data from the European Monetary System ( EMS ) , the US Dow Jones , the german Dax and the french Cac40 .

The numerical procedure is described in details and numerous simulations are provided to assert its efficiency . In particular , we carry out a comparison with the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm .
