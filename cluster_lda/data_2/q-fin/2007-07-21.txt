There are transaction costs with a structure that covers , in particular , the case of fixed plus proportional costs . We prove that there exists a self-financing trading strategy maximizing the average growth rate of the portfolio wealth . We show that this strategy has a Markovian form . Our result is obtained by large deviations estimates on empirical measures of the price process and by a generalization of the vanishing discount method to discontinuous transition operators .
