0706.3827	q-fin.ST physics.data-an physics.soc-ph	The fractional volatility model : An agent-based interpretation	Based on criteria of mathematical simplicity and consistency with empirical market data , a model with volatility driven by fractional noise has been constructed which provides a fairly accurate mathematical parametrization of the data . Here , some features of the model are discussed and , using agent-based models , one tries to find which agent strategies and ( or ) properties of the financial institutions might be responsible for the features of the fractional volatility model .
