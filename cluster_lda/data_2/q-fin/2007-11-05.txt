The results indicate that the stock market dynamics is not simply decomposable into 'market ' , 'sectors ' , and the Wishart random bulk . This clearly is seen when the time series used to construct the correlation matrices are sufficiently long and thus the measurement noise suppressed . Instead , a hierarchically convoluted and highly nonlinear organization of the market emerges and indicates that the relevant information about the whole market is encoded already in its constituents .

Forbidden patterns are related to the permutation entropy , which has the basic properties of classic chaos indicators , thus allowing to separate deterministic ( usually chaotic ) from random series ; however , it requires less values of the series to be calculated , and it is suitable for using with small datasets . In this Letter , the appearance of forbidden patterns is studied in different economical indicators like stock indices ( Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite ) , NYSE stocks ( IBM and Boeing ) and others ( 10-year Bond interest rate ) , to find evidences of deterministic behavior in their evolutions .
