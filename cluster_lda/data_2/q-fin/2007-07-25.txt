In this paper we planned to extend the analogy between different economic processes or phenomena and processes and phenomena from different fields of physics , other than statistical physics . On the basis of the economic development process and amplification phenomenon analogy , a new econophysics model , named economic amplifier , on the electronic amplification principle from applied physics was proposed und largely analyzed .
