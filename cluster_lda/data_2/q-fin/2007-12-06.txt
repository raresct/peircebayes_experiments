The distributions of relative logarithmic prices against reference prices in the three time periods are qualitatively the same with quantitative discrepancies . The order placement behavior is asymmetric between buyers and sellers and between the inside-the-book orders and outside-the-book orders . In addition , the conditional distributions of relative prices in the continuous auction are independent of the bid-ask spread and volatility . These findings are crucial to build an empirical behavioral microscopic model based on order flows for Chinese stocks .
