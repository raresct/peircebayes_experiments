0705.1297	q-fin.PR math.AP math.OC	Pricing Life Insurance under Stochastic Mortality via the Instantaneous Sharpe Ratio : Theorems and Proofs	We develop a pricing rule for life insurance under stochastic mortality in an incomplete market by assuming that the insurance company requires compensation for its risk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio . Our valuation formula satisfies a number of desirable properties , many of which it shares with the standard deviation premium principle . The major result of the paper is that the price per contract solves a linear partial differential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity . One can interpret the limiting price as an expectation with respect to an equivalent martingale measure . Another important result is that if the hazard rate is stochastic , then the risk-adjusted premium is greater than the net premium , even as the number of contracts approaches infinity . We present a numerical example to illustrate our results , along with the corresponding algorithms .
0705.1302	q-fin.PR math.AP math.OC	Financial Valuation of Mortality Risk via the Instantaneous Sharpe Ratio : Applications to Pricing Pure Endowments	We develop a theory for pricing non-diversifiable mortality risk in an incomplete market . We do this by assuming that the company issuing a mortality-contingent claim requires compensation for this risk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio . We prove that our ensuing valuation formula satisfies a number of desirable properties . For example , we show that it is subadditive in the number of contracts sold . A key result is that if the hazard rate is stochastic , then the risk-adjusted survival probability is greater than the physical survival probability , even as the number of contracts approaches infinity .
