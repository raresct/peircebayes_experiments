We investigate the role of common economic factors in the market in the formation of stock networks , using the arbitrage pricing model reflecting essential properties of common economic factors . We find that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks increases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our model . Furthermore , we find that individual stocks with a large number of links to other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic factors than those with a small number of links . This suggests that common economic factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of deterministic factors .
0705.0161	q-fin.GN physics.data-an physics.soc-ph	Quantitative relations between corruption and economic factors	We report quantitative relations between corruption level and economic factors , such as country wealth and foreign investment per capita , which are characterized by a power law spanning multiple scales of wealth and investments per capita . These relations hold for diverse countries , and also remain stable over different time periods . We also observe a negative correlation between level of corruption and long-term economic growth . We find similar results for two independent indices of corruption , suggesting that the relation between corruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption . The functional relations we report have implications when assessing the relative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth , and for quantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign investments .
