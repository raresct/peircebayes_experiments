To do this , we introduce a parameter BETA that limits the range on the wealth of a partner with which an agent is allowed to interact . We show that this wealth-limited interaction is enough to distribute wealth in a purely power law trend . If the interaction is not wealth limited , the wealth distribution is expectedly Gibbsian . The value of BETA where the transition from a purely Gibbsian law to a purely power law distribution happens depends on whether the choice of interaction partner is mutual nor not . For a non-mutual choice , where the richer agent gets to decide , the transition happens at BETA=1.0 . For a mutual choice , the transition is at BETA= 0.60 . In order to generate a mixed Gibbs-Pareto distribution , we apply another wealth-based rule that depends on the parameter w_limit . An agent whose wealth is below w_limit can choose any partner to interact with , while an agent whose wealth is above w_limit is subject to the wealth-limited range in his choice of partner . A Gibbs-Pareto distribution appears if both these wealth-based rules are applied .
