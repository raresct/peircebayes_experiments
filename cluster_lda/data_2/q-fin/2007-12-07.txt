0712.1093	q-fin.PR math.PR	The derivatives of Asian call option prices	The distribution of a time integral of geometric Brownian motion is not well understood . To price an Asian option and to obtain measures of its dependence on the parameters of time , strike price , and underlying market price , it is essential to have the distribution of time integral of geometric Brownian motion and it is also required to have a way to manipulate its distribution . We present integral forms for key quantities in the price of Asian option and its derivatives ( { \it { delta , gamma , theta , and vega } } ) . For example for any $ a > 0 $ $ \mathbb { E } [ ( A_t -a ) ^+ ] = t -a + a^ { 2 } \mathbb { E } [ ( a+A_t ) ^ { -1 } \exp ( \frac { 2M_t } { a+ A_t } - \frac { 2 } { a } ) ] $ , where $ A_t = \int^t_0 \exp ( B_s -s/2 ) ds $ and $ M_t =\exp ( B_t -t/2 ) . $
