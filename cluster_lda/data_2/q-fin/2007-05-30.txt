In this way we establish existence and uniqueness for a large class of utility maximization problems including the classical ones of terminal wealth or consumption , as well as the problems depending on a random time-horizon or multiple consumption instances . As an example we treat explicitly the problem of maximizing the logarithmic utility of a consumption stream , where the local time of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process acts as a stochastic clock .
