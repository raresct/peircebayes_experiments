We consider a combination of social interaction within peer groups and individually heterogeneous fundamentalist trading decisions which take into account the market price and the perceived fundamental value of the asset . The resulting excess demand is coupled to the market price . Rigorous analysis reveals that this feedback may lead to price oscillations , a single bounce , or monotonic price behaviour . The model is a rare example of an analytically tractable interacting-agent model which allows us to deduce in detail the origin of these different collective patterns . For a natural choice of initial distribution the results are independent of the graph structure that models the peer network of agents whose decisions influence each other .
