The extensions of quantum mechanics to statistical physics and information theory let us use some of their definitions for the best understanding of the behavior of economics and biology . The quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is the von Neumann equation . A system in where all its members are in Nash equilibrium is equivalent to a system in a maximum entropy state . Nature is a game in where its players compete for a common welfare and the equilibrium of the system that they are members . They act as a whole besides individuals like they obey a rule in where they prefer to work for the welfare of the collective besides the individual welfare .

We obtain two such theorems by considering a financial market both with and without a riskless asset for random consumption . The striking result is that we obtain two-fund theorems despite the additional source of randomness from consumption .
