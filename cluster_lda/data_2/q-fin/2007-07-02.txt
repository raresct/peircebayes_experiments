We then extend this work through a substantive analysis of examples provided by Meyer , Flitney , Iqbal and Weigert and Cheon and Tsutsui with respect to quantized games , quantum game strategies and the extension of Nash Equilibrium to solvable games in Hilbert space . Finally , we review earlier work by Sato , Taiji and Ikegami on non-linear computation and computational classes by way of reference to coherence , decoherence and quantum computating systems .
