We extend the standard log-normal process to include another random component in the so-called stochastic volatility models . We study these models under an assumption , akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation , in which the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and acts as a background to the evolution of the price process . In this approximation , we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit a scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns . We verify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling . We then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models , the Heston and Hull-White models . In particular , we show that in the Hull-White model the resulting probability distribution of log-returns in this approximation corresponds to the Tsallis ( t-Student ) distribution . The Tsallis parameters are given in terms of the microscopic stochastic volatility model . Finally , we show that the log-returns for 30 years Dow Jones index data is well fitted by a Tsallis distribution , obtaining the relevant parameters .
