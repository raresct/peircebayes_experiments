Our analysis implies that it might be that a quantum-like probabilistic description is more natural for financial market than the classical one . A part of our analysis is devoted to study the possibility of application of the quantum probabilistic model to agents of financial market . We show that , although the direct quantum ( physical ) reduction ( based on using the scales of quantum mechanics ) is meaningless , one may apply so called quantum-like models . In our approach quantum-like probabilistic behaviour is a consequence of contextualy of statistical data in finances ( and economics in general ) . However , our hypothesis on `` quantumness '' of financial data should be tested experimentally ( as opposed to the conventional description based on the noncontextual classical probabilistic approach ) . We present a new statistical test based on a generalization of the well known in quantum physics Bell 's inequality .
