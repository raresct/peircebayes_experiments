The minority game is a simple congestion game : players need to choose between two options , and those who have selected the option chosen by the minority win . The learning model proposed in this literature seems to differ markedly from the learning models commonly used in economics . We relate the learning model from the minority game literature to standard game-theoretic learning models , and show that in fact it shares many features with these models . However , the predictions of the learning model differ considerably from the predictions of most other learning models . We discuss the main predictions of the learning model proposed in the minority game literature , and compare these to experimental findings on congestion games .
