( 2001 ) Wiley ) . In our formulation , the market moves continuously , but an investor trades in discrete times , which can depend on the past path of the market . We prove that an investor can essentially force that the asset price path behaves with the variation exponent exactly equal to two . Our proof is based on embedding high-frequency discrete-time games into the continuous-time game and the use of the Bayesian strategy of Kumon , Takemura and Takeuchi ( Stoch . Anal . Appl . 26 ( 2008 ) 1161 -- 1180 ) for discrete-time coin-tossing games . We also show that the main growth part of the investor 's capital processes is clearly described by the information quantities , which are derived from the Kullback -- Leibler information with respect to the empirical fluctuation of the asset price .

Calculating the local Hurst exponent for the WIG time series we find an interesting dependence between the behavior of the local fractal properties of the WIG time series and the crashes appearance on the financial market .
