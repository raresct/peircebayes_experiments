0801.0108	q-fin.ST physics.data-an physics.soc-ph	Note on two phase phenomena in financial markets	The two phase behavior in financial markets actually means the bifurcation phenomenon , which represents the change of the conditional probability from an unimodal to a bimodal distribution . In this paper , the bifurcation phenomenon in Hang-Seng index is carefully investigated . It is observed that the bifurcation phenomenon in financial index is not universal , but specific under certain conditions . The phenomenon just emerges when the power-law exponent of absolute increment distribution is between 1 and 2 with appropriate period . Simulations on a randomly generated time series suggest the bifurcation phenomenon itself is subject to the statistics of absolute increment , thus it may not be able to reflect the essential financial behaviors . However , even under the same distribution of absolute increment , the range where bifurcation phenomenon occurs is far different from real market to artificial data , which may reflect certain market information .
