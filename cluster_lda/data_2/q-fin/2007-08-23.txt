Econophysical analyses of transaction data for the US and Australian stock markets have uncovered market-specific scaling laws , where a master curve of price impact can be obtained in each market when stock capitalization $ C $ is included as an argument in the scaling relation . However , the rationale of introducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalous negative correlation between price change $ r $ and trade size $ \omega $ for small trades is unexplained . Here we show that these issues can be addressed by taking into account the aggressiveness of orders that result in trades together with a proper normalization technique . Using order book data from the Chinese market , we show that trades from filled and partially filled limit orders have very different price impact . The price impact of trades from partially filled orders is constant when the volume is not too large , while that of filled orders shows power-law behavior $ r\sim \omega^\alpha $ with $ \alpha\approx2/3 $ . When returns and volumes are normalized by stock-dependent averages , capitalization-independent scaling laws emerge for both types of trades . However , no scaling relation in terms of stock capitalization can be constructed . In addition , the relation $ \alpha=\alpha_\omega/\alpha_r $ is verified , where $ \alpha_\omega $ and $ \alpha_r $ are the tail exponents of trade sizes and returns . These observations also enable us to explain the anomalous negative correlation between $ r $ and $ \omega $ for small-size trades . We anticipate that these regularities may hold in other order-driven markets .
