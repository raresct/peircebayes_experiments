Different kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades . Nowadays , all transactions on a financial market are recorded , leading to a huge amount of data available , either for free in the Internet or commercially . Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as to theoreticians , for making inferences and predictions . Furthermore , the stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to economists , but also to statisticians and physicists . While it would be a formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic , with this review we try to give a flavor of some of its aspects .
