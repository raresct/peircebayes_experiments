( 2 ) Time is defined by the progression of 3-geometries , just as originally proposed by DeWitt . ( 3 ) The initial ( D-1 ) -dimensional `` path integral '' is converted from Euclidean to Lorentzian form by transformation of the fields in the integrand .

The practical advantages of these bright ultrabroadband light sources for spectroscopy are reported in the near-infrared region . A Cr^4+ : YAG femtosecond laser broadened by an extruded soft-glass photonic crystal fiber , emitting from 1200 to 2200 nm and from 675 to 950 nm , provides a spectral radiance being 1x10^5 times higher than that of a 3000 K blackbody and 10^2 times higher than that of a synchrotron radiation . The C_2H_2 and NH_3 overtone spectra are recorded using this source within a few seconds .

Comp . Phys . 215 , 59-80 ( 2006 ) ] is applied to simulate the problem of MHD island coalescence instability ( MICI ) in two dimensions . MICI is a fundamental MHD process that can produce sharp current layers and subsequent reconnection and heating in a high-Lundquist number plasma such as the solar corona [ Ng and Bhattacharjee , Phys . Plasmas , 5 , 4028 ( 1998 ) ] . Due to the formation of thin current layers , it is highly desirable to use adaptively or statically refined grids to resolve them , and to maintain accuracy at the same time . The output of the spectral-element static adaptive refinement simulations are compared with simulations using a finite difference method on the same refinement grids , and both methods are compared to pseudo-spectral simulations with uniform grids as baselines . It is shown that with the statically refined grids roughly scaling linearly with effective resolution , spectral element runs can maintain accuracy significantly higher than that of the finite difference runs , in some cases achieving close to full spectral accuracy .
0711.3874	physics.flu-dyn math.DS nlin.PS physics.class-ph	The meandering instability of a viscous thread	A viscous thread falling from a nozzle onto a surface exhibits the famous rope-coiling effect , in which the thread buckles to form loops . If the surface is replaced by a belt moving with speed $ U $ , the rotational symmetry of the buckling instability is broken and a wealth of interesting states are observed [ See S. Chiu-Webster and J. R. Lister , J. Fluid Mech. , { \bf 569 } , 89 ( 2006 ) ] . We experimentally studied this `` fluid mechanical sewing machine '' in a new , more precise apparatus . As $ U $ is reduced , the steady catenary thread bifurcates into a meandering state in which the thread displacements are only transverse to the motion of the belt . We measured the amplitude and frequency $ \omega $ of the meandering close to the bifurcation . For smaller $ U $ , single-frequency meandering bifurcates to a two-frequency `` figure eight '' state , which contains a significant $ 2\omega $ component and parallel as well as transverse displacements . This eventually reverts to single-frequency coiling at still smaller $ U $ . More complex , highly hysteretic states with additional frequencies are observed for larger nozzle heights . We propose to understand this zoology in terms of the generic amplitude equations appropriate for resonant interactions between two oscillatory modes with frequencies $ \omega $ and $ 2\omega $ . The form of the amplitude equations captures both the axisymmetry of the U=0 coiling state and the symmetry-breaking effects induced by the moving belt .
0711.3876	physics.bio-ph	Dihedral-angle Gaussian distribution driving protein folding	The proposal of this paper is to provide a simple angular random walk model to build up polypeptide structures , which encompass properties of dihedral angles of folded proteins . From this model , structures will be built with lengths ranging from 125 up to 400 amino acids for the different fractions of secondary structure motifs , which dihedral angles were randomly chosen according to narrow Gaussian probability distributions . In order to measure the fractal dimension of proteins three different cases were analyzed . The first contained alpha-helix structures only , the second beta-strands structures and the third a mix of alpha-helices and beta-sheets . The behavior of proteins with alpha-helix motifs are more compacted than in other situations . The findings herein indicate that this model describes some structural properties of a protein and suggest that randomness is an essential ingredient but proteins are driven by narrow angular Gaussian probability distributions and not by random-walk processes .
