0706.1608	physics.atom-ph	Magneto-optical Trapping of Cadmium	We report the laser-cooling and confinement of Cd atoms in a magneto-optical trap , and characterize the loading process from the background Cd vapor . The trapping laser drives the 1S0-1P1 transition at 229 nm in this two-electron atom and also photoionizes atoms directly from the 1P1 state . This photoionization overwhelms the other loss mechanisms and allows a direct measurement of the photoionization cross section , which we measure to be 2 ( 1 ) x10^ ( -16 ) cm^ ( 2 ) from the 1P1 state . When combined with nearby laser-cooled and trapped Cd^ ( + ) ions , this apparatus could facilitate studies in ultracold interactions between atoms and ions .
0706.1645	physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech	Dynamics of Three Agent Games	We study the dynamics and resulting score distribution of three-agent games where after each competition a single agent wins and scores a point . A single competition is described by a triplet of numbers $ p $ , $ t $ and $ q $ denoting the probabilities that the team with the highest , middle or lowest accumulated score wins . We study the full family of solutions in the regime , where the number of agents and competitions is large , which can be regarded as a hydrodynamic limit . Depending on the parameter values $ ( p , q , t ) $ , we find six qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we also provide a qualitative understanding of these results . We checked our analytical results against numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in excellent agreement . The three agent game can be regarded as a social model where a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement , based on his/her accumulated score . It is also possible to decide the outcome of a three agent game through a mini tournament of two-a gent competitions among the participating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score distributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three agent-games . We discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model and present a simple geometric construction that allows one to write down the corresponding score evolution equations for $ n $ -agent games .
0706.1661	physics.class-ph	Quantum electrodynamics and experiment demonstrate the non-retarded nature of electrodynamical force fields	In quantum electrodynamics , the quantitatively most successful theory in the history of science , intercharge forces obeying the inverse square law are due to the exchange of space-like virtual photons . The fundamental quantum process underlying applications as diverse as the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron and electrical machinery is then M { \o } ller scattering $ ee \to ee $ . Analysis of the quantum amplitude for this process shows that the corresponding intercharge force acts instantaneously . This prediction has been verified in a recent experiment .
0706.1683	physics.bio-ph physics.atm-clus	Simple Combined Model for Nonlinear Excitations in DNA	We propose a new simple model for DNA denaturation bases on the pendulum model of Englander\cite { A1 } and the microscopic model of Peyrard { \it et al . } , \cite { A3 } so called `` combined model '' . The main parameters of our model are : the coupling constant $ k $ along each strand , the mean stretching $ y^\ast $ of the hydrogen bonds , the ratio of the damping constant and driven force $ \gamma/F $ . We show that both the length $ L $ of unpaired bases and the velocity $ v $ of kinks depend on not only the coupling constant $ k $ but also the temperature $ T $ . Our results are in good agreement with previous works .
0706.1685	physics.bio-ph physics.gen-ph	Theory on Plasmon Modes of the Cell Membranes	Considering the plasmon oscillation of each layer of the cell membranes as a quasi-particle , we introduce a simple model for the membrane collective charge excitations , take into account the surface effective potential of the plasmon-plasmon interaction between two layers . By using the useful Bogoliubov transformation method , we easily obtained the expressions of the frequencies of plasmon oscillations as a function of wave-number $ k $ and membrane thickness $ d $ , magnitude of these frequencies is in the order of $ \sqrt { kd } $ . Our results are in good agreement with ones obtained by E. Manousakis .
0706.1693	physics.chem-ph	Unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition theorems for Slater type orbitals and Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials of integer and noninteger indices	Using one-center expansion relations for the Slater type orbitals ( STOs ) of noninteger principal quantum numbers in terms of integer n STOs derived in this study with the help of - exponential type orbitals ( -ETOs , the general formulas are established for the unsymmetrical and symmetrical one-range addition theorems of STOs and Coulomb-Yukawa like correlated interaction potentials ( CIPs ) with integer and noninteger indices . The final results are especially useful for computations of arbitrary multicenter multielectron integrals over STOs that arise in the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan ( HFR ) approximation and also in the correlated methods which play a significant role in theory and application to quantum mechanics of atoms , molecules , and solids .
0706.1705	physics.atom-ph physics.optics	Investigations of Ra $ ^+ $ properties to test possibilities of new optical frequency standards	The present work tests the suitability of the narrow transitions $ 7s \ ^2S_ { 1/2 } \to 6d ^2D_ { 3/2 } $ and $ 7s ^2S_ { 1/2 } \to 6d ^2D_ { 5/2 } $ in Ra $ ^+ $ for optical frequency standard studies . Our calculations of the lifetimes of the metastable $ 6d $ states using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory suggest that they are sufficiently long for Ra $ ^+ $ to be considered as a potential candidate for an atomic clock . This is further corroborated by our studies of the hyperfine interactions , dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments of the appropriate states of this system .

0706.1757	physics.chem-ph	Basis set convergence of post-CCSD contributions to molecular atomization energies	Basis set convergence of correlation effects on molecular atomization energies beyond the CCSD ( coupled cluster with singles and doubles ) approximation has been studied near the one-particle basis set limit . Quasiperturbative connected triple excitations , ( T ) , converge more rapidly than $ L^ { -3 } $ ( where $ L $ is the highest angular momentum represented in the basis set ) , while higher-order connected triples , $ T_3- ( T ) $ , converge more slowly -- empirically , $ \propto L^ { -5/2 } $ . Quasiperturbative connected quadruple excitations , ( Q ) , converge smoothly as $ \propto L^ { -3 } $ starting with the cc-pVTZ basis set , while the cc-pVDZ basis set causes overshooting of the contribution in highly polar systems . Higher-order connected quadruples display only weak , but somewhat erratic , basis set dependence . Connected quintuple excitations converge very rapidly with the basis set , to the point where even an unpolarized double-zeta basis set yields useful numbers . In cases where fully iterative CCSDTQ5 ( coupled cluster up to connected quintuples ) calculations are not an option , CCSDTQ ( 5 ) ( i.e. , coupled cluster up to connected quadruples plus a quasiperturbative connected quintuples correction ) can not be relied upon in the presence of significant nondynamical correlation , whereas CCSDTQ ( 5 ) $ _\Lambda $ represents a viable alternative . Connected quadruples corrections to the core-valence contribution are thermochemically significant in some systems . [ ... ] We conclude that `` $ 3\sigma\leq 1 $ kJ/mol '' thermochemistry is feasible with current technology , but that the more ambitious goal of $ \pm $ 10 cm $ ^ { -1 } $ accuracy is illusory , at least for atomization energies .
0706.1758	physics.data-an	Statistics of football dynamics	We investigate the dynamics of football matches . Our goal is to characterize statistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sport game , searching for traits of complex behavior . Data were collected over a variety of matches in South American , European and World championships throughout 2005 and 2006 . We show that the statistics of ball touches presents power-law tails and can be described by $ q $ -gamma distributions . To explain such behavior we propose a model that provides information on the characteristics of football dynamics . Furthermore , we discuss the statistics of duration of out-of-play intervals , not directly related to the previous scenario .

0706.1814	physics.geo-ph	Study of the structural changes in the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico related to microseismicity by applying the lineament analysis to the Aster ( Terra ) satellite data	Mexico is one of the most volcanically active regions in North America . Volcanic activity in central Mexico is associated with the subduction of the Cocos and Rivera plates beneath the North American plate . Periods of enhanced microseismic activity , associated with the volcanic activity of the Popocatepetl volcano is compared with periods , during which the microseismic activity was low . We detected systematical changes in the number of lineaments , associated with the microseismic activity due to lineament analysis of a temporal sequence of high resolution satellite images of the Popocatepetl volcano , provided by the ASTER/VNIR instrument . The Lineament Extraction and Stripes Statistic Analysis ( LESSA ) software package was used for the lineament extraction . In the future it would allow develop a methodology for detection of possible elevation of pressure in volcano edifice .
0706.1816	physics.atom-ph	Excitation energies , polarizabilities , multipole transition rates , and lifetimes of ions along the francium isoelectronic sequence	Relativistic many-body perturbation theory is applied to study properties of ions of the francium isoelectronic sequence . Specifically , energies of the 7s , 7p , 6d , and 5f states of Fr-like ions with nuclear charges Z = 87 - 100 are calculated through third order ; reduced matrix elements , oscillator strengths , transition rates , and lifetimes are determined for 7s - 7p , 7p - 6d , and 6d - 5f electric-dipole transitions ; and 7s - 6d , 7s - 5f , and 5f_5/2 - 5f_7/2 multipole matrix elements are evaluated to obtain the lifetimes of low-lying excited states . Moreover , for the ions Z = 87 - 92 calculations are also carried out using the relativistic all-order single-double method , in which single and double excitations of Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders in perturbation theory . With the aid of the SD wave functions , we obtain accurate values of energies , transition rates , oscillator strengths , and the lifetimes of these six ions . Ground state scalar polarizabilities in Fr I , Ra II , Ac III , and Th IV are calculated using relativistic third-order and all-order methods . Ground state scalar polarizabilities for other Fr-like ions are calculated using a relativistic second-order method . These calculations provide a theoretical benchmark for comparison with experiment and theory .
