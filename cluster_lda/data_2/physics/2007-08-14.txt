0708.1806	physics.atom-ph	Precision Test of Mass Ratio Variations with Lattice-Confined Ultracold Molecules	We propose a precision measurement of time variations of the proton-electron mass ratio using ultracold molecules in an optical lattice . Vibrational energy intervals are sensitive to changes of the mass ratio . In contrast to measurements that use hyperfine-interval-based atomic clocks , the scheme discussed here is model-independent and does not require separation of time variations of different physical constants . The possibility of applying the zero-differential-Stark-shift optical lattice technique is explored to measure vibrational transitions at high accuracy .

Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm where biological and artificially-created nanomachines communicate over a short distance using molecules . A molecular propagation system in molecular communication directionally transports molecules from a sender to a receiver . In the design described in this paper , protein filaments glide over immobilized motor proteins along preconfigured microlithographic tracks , and the gliding protein filaments carry and transport molecules from a sender to a receiver . In the design , DNA hybridization is used to load and unload the molecules onto and from the carriers at a sender and a receiver . In the design , loading/transporting/unloading processes are autonomous and require no external control .

Using simulated Bio-Nano environments in VR , the operator can design and characterize through physical simulation and 3-D visualization the behavior of Bio-NanoRobotic components and structures . The main novelty of the proposed simulations is based on the characterization of stiffness performances of passive joints-based deca-alanine protein molecule and active joints-based viral protein motor ( VPL ) in their native environment . Their use as elementary Bio-NanoRobotic components ( 1 dof platform ) are also simulated and the results discussed .

Because of its low damage on observed cells and better signal-to- background ratio , two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy is used to observe NAD ( P ) H autofluorescence of macrophage under difference cultured conditions- bare cover glass , coated with fibronectin or poly-D-lysine . The results show that the optimal condition is fibronectin coated surface , on which , macrophages profile can be clearly identified on NAD ( P ) H autofluorescence images collected by two-photon microscopy . Moreover , different morphology and intensities of autofluorescence under different conditions were observed as well . In the future , effects of ox-LDL on macrophages will be investigated by purposed system to research etiology of atherosclerosis .
0708.1860	physics.flu-dyn physics.plasm-ph	Stable curved solitonic surfaces in nonholonomic frame	Assuming the stability of soliton surfaces of vanishing Ricci sectional curvature of soliton metric in the nonholonomic frame , we find a solution for the metric in the approximation of weak constant torsion curves with constant Frenet curvature . The computation of the Riemann tensor of the soliton metric shows that it does not vanish and therefore the solution is nontrivial . Heisenberg solitonic equation is also used to constrain the the soliton Riemann metric . The new feature here is that the coordinate curves on the soliton-like surface are composed of hydrodynamical filaments .
0708.1861	physics.class-ph	Origins of the Combinatorial Basis of Entropy	The combinatorial basis of entropy , given by Boltzmann , can be written $ H = N^ { -1 } \ln \mathbb { W } $ , where $ H $ is the dimensionless entropy , $ N $ is the number of entities and $ \mathbb { W } $ is number of ways in which a given realization of a system can occur ( its statistical weight ) . This can be broadened to give generalized combinatorial ( or probabilistic ) definitions of entropy and cross-entropy : $ H=\kappa ( \phi ( \mathbb { W } ) +C ) $ and $ D=-\kappa ( \phi ( \mathbb { P } ) +C ) $ , where $ \mathbb { P } $ is the probability of a given realization , $ \phi $ is a convenient transformation function , $ \kappa $ is a scaling parameter and $ C $ an arbitrary constant . If $ \mathbb { W } $ or $ \mathbb { P } $ satisfy the multinomial weight or distribution , then using $ \phi ( \cdot ) =\ln ( \cdot ) $ and $ \kappa=N^ { -1 } $ , $ H $ and $ D $ asymptotically converge to the Shannon and Kullback-Leibler functions . In general , however , $ \mathbb { W } $ or $ \mathbb { P } $ need not be multinomial , nor may they approach an asymptotic limit . In such cases , the entropy or cross-entropy function can be { \it defined } so that its extremization ( `` MaxEnt '' or `` MinXEnt '' ) , subject to the constraints , gives the `` most probable '' ( `` MaxProb '' ) realization of the system . This gives a probabilistic basis for MaxEnt and MinXEnt , independent of any information-theoretic justification . This work examines the origins of the governing distribution $ \mathbb { P } $ ... .

0708.1862	physics.soc-ph	Spectral methods and cluster structure in correlation-based networks	We investigate how in complex systems the eigenpairs of the matrices derived from the correlations of multichannel observations reflect the cluster structure of the underlying networks . For this we use daily return data from the NYSE and focus specifically on the spectral properties of weight W_ { ij } = |C|_ { ij } - \delta_ { ij } and diffusion matrices D_ { ij } = W_ { ij } /s_j- \delta_ { ij } , where C_ { ij } is the correlation matrix and s_i = \sum_j W_ { ij } the strength of node j . The eigenvalues ( and corresponding eigenvectors ) of the weight matrix are ranked in descending order . In accord with the earlier observations the first eigenvector stands for a measure of the market correlations . Its components are to first approximation equal to the strengths of the nodes and there is a second order , roughly linear , correction . The high ranking eigenvectors , excluding the highest ranking one , are usually assigned to market sectors and industrial branches . Our study shows that both for weight and diffusion matrices the eigenpair analysis is not capable of easily deducing the cluster structure of the network without a priori knowledge . In addition we have studied the clustering of stocks using the asset graph approach with and without spectrum based noise filtering . It turns out that asset graphs are quite insensitive to noise and there is no sharp percolation transition as a function of the ratio of bonds included , thus no natural threshold value for that ratio seems to exist . We suggest that these observations can be of use for other correlation based networks as well .
0708.1886	physics.optics	Quantitative Determination of Enhanced and Suppressed Transmission through Subwavelength Slit Arrays in Silver Films	Measurement of the transmitted intensity from a coherent monomode light source through a series of subwavelength slit arrays in Ag films , with varying array pitch and number of slits , demonstrate enhancement ( suppression ) by as much as a factor of 6 ( 9 ) when normalized to that of an isolated slit . Pronounced minima in the transmitted intensity were observed at array pitches corresponding to lambda_SPP , 2lambda_SPP , and 3lambda_SPP where lambda_SPP is the wavelength of the surface plasmon polariton ( SPP ) . Increasing the number of slits to more than four does not increase appreciably the per-slit transmission intensity . These results are consistent with a model for interference between SPPs and the incident wave that fits well the measured transmitted intensity profile .

Gamma rays from the decay of xenon metastable states , produced by fast neutron activation , were detected and their activities measured in a LXe scintillation detector . Following a five-day activation of natural xenon gas with a Cf-252 ( 4 x 10^5 n/s ) source , the activities of two gamma ray lines at 164 keV and 236 keV , from Xe-131m and Xe-129m metastable states , were measured at about 95 and 130 Bq/kg , respectively . We also observed three additional lines at 35 keV , 100 keV and 275 keV , which decay away within a few days . No long-lifetime activity was observed after the neutron activation .

Many important electron correlations are considered to all-orders using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory . Calculated ionization potentials are compared with the experimental values , wherever available . To our knowledge , oscillator strengths of magnetic dipole and electric quardupole transitions are estimated for the first time . The transitions span in the range of ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared regions and are important for astrophysical observations .
