Their modal properties are full of relevant information concerning its dynamic behaviour in its elastic domain . The main scope of this paper is to determine relevant , though simple , beam modelling whose validity could be easily checked with experimental data . In this study , we recorded ambient vibrations in 3 buildings in Grenoble selected because of their vertical structural homogeneity . First , a set of recordings was done using a 18 channels digital acquisition system ( CityShark ) connected to six 3C Lennartz 5s sensors . We used the Frequency Domain Decomposition ( FDD ) technique to extract the modal parameters of these buildings . Second , it is shown in the following that the experimental quasi-elastic behaviour of such structure can be reduced to the behaviour of a vertical continuous Timoshenko beam . A parametric study of this beam shows that a bijective relation exists between the beam parameters and its eigenfrequencies distribution . Consequently , the Timoshenko beam parameters can be estimated from the experimental sequence of eigenfrequencies . Having the beam parameters calibrated by the in situ data , the reliability of the modelling is checked by complementary comparisons . For this purpose , the mode shapes and eigenfrequencies of higher modes are calculated and compared to the experimental data . A good agreement is also obtained . In addition , the beam model integrates in a very synthetic way the essential parameters of the dynamic behaviour .

The probability of correctness of forecasts shifts probabilities of branching . The formula for the shift of probabilities leads to the velocity addition rule of the special theory of relativity . In the absence of information about bookmaker 's wagers the stochastic logarithmic rates completely determines the optimal stakes of forecast gambler .
0709.4143	physics.soc-ph physics.data-an	A weighted network evolution model based on passenger behavior	This paper presents an evolution model of weighted networks in which the structural growth and weight dynamics are driven by human behavior , i.e . passenger route choice behavior . Transportation networks grow due to people's increasing travel demand and the pattern of growth is determined by their route choice behavior . In airline networks passengers often transfer from a third airport instead of flying directly to the destination , which contributes to the hubs formation and finally the scale-free statistical property . In this model we assume at each time step there emerges a new node with m travel destinations . Then the new node either connects destination directly with the probability p or transfers from a third node with the probability 1-p . The analytical result shows degree and strength both obey power-law distribution with the exponent between 2.33 and 3 depending on p. The weights also obey power-law distribution . The clustering coefficient , degree assortatively coefficient and degree-strength correlation are all dependent on the probability p. This model can also be used in social networks .

If the two-body scattering length is positive , a number of vibrational states is finite for $ L_c ( m/m_1 ) \le L \le L_b ( m/m_1 ) $ , zero for $ L > L_b ( m/m_1 ) $ , and infinite for $ L < L_c ( m/m_1 ) $ . If the two-body scattering length is negative , a number of states is either zero for $ L \ge L_c ( m/m_1 ) $ or infinite for $ L < L_c ( m/m_1 ) $ . For a finite number of vibrational states , all the binding energies are described by the universal function $ \epsilon_ { LN } ( m/m_1 ) = { \cal E } ( \xi , \eta ) $ , where $ \xi=\displaystyle\frac { N-1/2 } { \sqrt { L ( L + 1 ) } } $ , $ \eta=\displaystyle\sqrt { \frac { m } { m_1 L ( L + 1 ) } } $ , and $ N $ is the vibrational quantum number . This scaling dependence is in agreement with the numerical calculations for $ L > 2 $ and only slightly deviates from those for $ L = 1 , 2 $ . The universal description implies that the critical values $ L_c ( m/m_1 ) $ and $ L_b ( m/m_1 ) $ increase as $ 0.401 \sqrt { m/m_1 } $ and $ 0.563 \sqrt { m/m_1 } $ , respectively , while a number of vibrational states for $ L \ge L_c ( m/m_1 ) $ is within the range $ N \le N_ { max } \approx 1.1 \sqrt { L ( L+1 ) } +1/2 $ .
0709.4192	physics.acc-ph	Parametrization of the Driven Betatron Oscillation	An AC dipole is a magnet which produces a sinusoidally oscillating dipole field and excites coherent transverse beam motion in a synchrotron . By observing this coherent motion , the optical parameters can be directly measured at the beam position monitor locations . The driven oscillation induced by an AC dipole will generate a phase space ellipse which differs from that of the free oscillation . If not properly accounted for , this difference can lead to a misinterpretation of the actual optical parameters , for instance , of 6 % or more in the cases of the Tevatron , RHIC , or LHC . The effect of an AC dipole on the linear optics parameters is identical to that of a thin lens quadrupole . By introducing a new amplitude function to describe this new phase space ellipse , the motion produced by an AC dipole becomes easier to interpret . Beam position data taken under the influence of an AC dipole , with this new interpretation in mind , can lead to more precise measurements of the normal Courant-Snyder parameters . This new parameterization of the driven motion is presented and is used to interpret data taken in the FNAL Tevatron using an AC dipole .

We have discovered that slow , non-ergodic conformational fluctuations of the protein , coupled to hydrating water , result in a very broad distribution of donor-acceptor energy gaps far exceeding that observed for commonly studied inorganic and organic donor-acceptor complexes . The Stokes shift is not affected by these fluctuations and can be calculated from solvation models in terms of the response of the solvent dipolar polarization . The non-ergodic character of large-amplitude protein/water mobility breaks the strong link between the Stokes shift and reorganization energy characteristic of equilibrium ( ergodic ) theories of electron transfer . This mechanism might be responsible for low activation barriers in natural electron transfer proteins characterized by low reaction free energy .

It can be efficiently created and probed via resonant interactions with light , the technique which is at the heart of modern atomic clocks and magnetometers . Recently , nonlinear magneto-optical techniques have been developed for selective production and detection of higher polarization moments , hexadecapole and hexacontatetrapole , in the ground states of the alkali atoms . Extension of these techniques into the range of geomagnetic fields is important for practical applications . This is because hexadecapole polarization corresponding to the $ \Delta M=4 $ Zeeman coherence , with maximum possible $ \Delta M $ for electronic angular momentum $ J=1/2 $ and nuclear spin $ I=3/2 $ , is insensitive to the nonlinear Zeeman effect ( NLZ ) . This is of particular interest because NLZ normally leads to resonance splitting and systematic errors in atomic magnetometers . However , optical signals due to the hexadecapole moment decline sharply as a function of magnetic field . We report a novel method that allows selective creation of a macroscopic long-lived ground-state hexadecapole polarization . The immunity of the hexadecapole signal to NLZ is demonstrated with F=2 $ ^ { 87 } $ Rb atoms at Earth 's field .

The peak phase shift in the sample required for limiting is smaller than for a fundamental Gaussian beam with the added flexibility that the nonlinear medium can be placed either in front of or behind the beam focus .
0709.4296	physics.chem-ph	Chemical System Complexity and Bifurcation Point : a New Relationship	The article introduces a new relationship between the chemical system complexity and deviation of its bifurcation point from thermodynamic equilibrium . In the formalism of discrete thermodynamics of chemical equilibria , simulation of numerous equilibrium cases with regards to complexity of the reaction hosting systems has lead to a conclusion that the system deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium at the bifurcation point is directly proportional to logarithm of the system complexity parameter . With this relationship one can predict the efforts that are sufficient to destabilize the system thermodynamic branch and achieve the bifurcations area .
