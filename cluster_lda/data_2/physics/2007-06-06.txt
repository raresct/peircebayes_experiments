The movement of the electron beam in the volume of the diode is described . An analytic dependence of the volt-ampere characteristics in an unlimited and limited by the field mode of the electron beam is derived .
0706.0796	physics.atom-ph	Continuous loading of $ ^ { 1 } $ S $ _ { 0 } $ calcium atoms into an optical dipole trap	We demonstrate an efficient scheme for continuous trap loading based upon spatially selective optical pumping . We discuss the case of $ ^ { 1 } $ S $ _ { 0 } $ calcium atoms in an optical dipole trap ( ODT ) , however , similar strategies should be applicable to a wide range of atomic species . Our starting point is a reservoir of moderately cold ( $ \approx 300 \mu $ K ) metastable $ ^ { 3 } $ P $ _ { 2 } $ -atoms prepared by means of a magneto-optic trap ( triplet-MOT ) . A focused 532 nm laser beam produces a strongly elongated optical potential for $ ^ { 1 } $ S $ _ { 0 } $ -atoms with up to 350 $ \mu $ K well depth . A weak focused laser beam at 430 nm , carefully superimposed upon the ODT beam , selectively pumps the $ ^ { 3 } $ P $ _ { 2 } $ -atoms inside the capture volume to the singlet state , where they are confined by the ODT . The triplet-MOT perpetually refills the capture volume with $ ^ { 3 } $ P $ _ { 2 } $ -atoms thus providing a continuous stream of cold atoms into the ODT at a rate of $ 10^7 $ s $ ^ { -1 } $ . Limited by evaporation loss , in 200 ms we typically load $ 5 \times 10^5 $ atoms with an initial radial temperature of 85 $ \mu $ K . After terminating the loading we observe evaporation during 50 ms leaving us with $ 10^5 $ atoms at radial temperatures close to 40 $ \mu $ K and a peak phase space density of $ 6.8 \times 10^ { -5 } $ . We point out that a comparable scheme could be employed to load a dipole trap with $ ^ { 3 } $ P $ _ { 0 } $ -atoms .

0706.0816	physics.flu-dyn	Nonlocal Phenomenology for anisotropic MHD turbulence	A non-local cascade model for anisotropic MHD turbulence in the presence of a guiding magnetic field is proposed . The model takes into account that ( a ) energy cascades in an anisotropic manner and as a result a different estimate for the cascade rate in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the guiding field is made . ( b ) the interactions that result in the cascade are between different scales . Eddies with wave numbers $ k_\| $ and $ k_\perp $ interact with eddies with wave numbers $ q_\| , q_\perp $ such that a resonance condition between the wave numbers $ q_\| , q_\perp $ and $ k_\| , k_\perp $ holds . As a consequence energy from the eddy with wave numbers $ k_\| $ and $ k_\perp $ cascades due to interactions with eddies located in the resonant manifold whose wavenumbers are determined by : $ q_\|\simeq \epsilon^ { { 1 } / { 3 } } k_\perp^ { 2/3 } /B $ , $ q_\perp=k_\perp $ and energy will cascade along the lines $ k_\|\sim C+k_\perp^ { 2/3 } \epsilon^ { 1/3 } /B_0 $ . For a uniform energy injection rate in the parallel direction the resulting energy spectrum is $ E ( k_\| , k_\perp ) \simeq \epsilon^ { 2/3 } k_\|^ { -1 } k_\perp^ { -5/3 } $ . For a general forcing however the model suggests a non-universal behavior . The connections with previous models , numerical simulations and weak turbulence theory are discussed .
0706.0837	physics.class-ph	Saturation effects in the sub-Doppler spectroscopy of Cesium vapor confined in an Extremely Thin Cell	Saturation effects affecting absorption and fluorescence spectra of an atomic vapor confined in an Extremely Thin Cell ( cell thickness $ L < 1 \mu m $ ) are investigated experimentally and theoretically . The study is performed on the $ D_ { 2 } $ line ( $ \lambda ~= ~852 nm ) $ of $ Cs $ and concentrates on the two situations $ L = \lambda /2 $ and $ L =\lambda $ , the most contrasted ones with respect to the length dependence of the coherent Dicke narrowing . For $ L = \lambda /2 $ , the Dicke-narrowed absorption profile simply broadens and saturates in amplitude when increasing the light intensity , while for $ L =\lambda $ , sub-Doppler dips of reduced absorption at line-center appear on the broad absorption profile . For a fluorescence detection at $ L =\lambda $ , saturation induces narrow dips , but only for hyperfine components undergoing a population loss through optical pumping . These experimental results are interpreted with the help of the various existing models , and are compared with numerical calculations based upon a two-level modelling that considers both a closed and an open system .
0706.0842	physics.gen-ph	Using quantum computing models for graviton communication/information processing in cosmological evolution	In 2001 , Seth Lloyd presented a radical new critique of the universe as a quantum computing device , with an upper limit of bit calculations of the order of 10 to the 120 power . We find that his calculations permit us to reconcile the existance of a huge cosmological constant 10 to the minus 43 seconds after the big bang , with a resulting huge relic graviton flux , with the existance of a CMBR observational barrier of z = 1100 years after the big bang . Lloyd's calculations pre suppose the existence of a huge entropy value during the nucleation of a new universe , a datum we think helps shed light on the cosmological landscape problem .
0706.0863	physics.chem-ph	First principles study of magnetism in nanographenes	Magnetism in nanographenes ( also know as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or PAHs ) are studied with first principles density functional calculations . We find that an antiferromagnetic ( AFM ) phase appears as the PAH reaches a certain size . This AFM phase in PAHs has the same origin as the one in infinitely long zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons , namely , from the localized electronic state at the zigzag edge . The smallest PAH still having an AFM ground state is identified . With increased length of the zigzag edge , PAHs approach an infinitely long ribbon in terms of ( 1 ) the energetic ordering and difference among the AFM , ferromagnetic ( FM ) , and nonmagnetic ( NM ) phases and ( 2 ) the average local magnetic moment at the zigzag edges . These PAHs serve as ideal targets for chemical synthesis of nanographenes that possess magnetic properties . Moreover , our calculations support the interpretation that experimentally observed magnetism in activated carbon fibers originates from the zigzag edges of the nanographenes .
0706.0871	physics.atom-ph nlin.CD	Experimental Realization of Quantum-Resonance Ratchets	Quantum-resonance ratchets associated with the periodically kicked particle are experimentally realized for the first time . This is achieved by using a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a pulsed standing light wave and prepared in an initial state differing from the usual plane wave . Both the standing-wave potential and the initial state have a point symmetry around some center and the ratchet arises from the non-coincidence of the two centers . The dependence of the directed quantum transport on the quasimomentum is studied . A detailed theoretical analysis is used to explain the experimental results .
0706.0922	physics.space-ph physics.geo-ph	Radial distribution of the inner magnetosphere plasma pressure using low-altitude satellite data during geomagnetic storm : the March 1-8 , 1982 Event	Plasma pressure distribution in the inner magnetosphere is one of the key parameters for understanding the main magnetospheric processes including geomagnetic storms and substorms . However , the pressure profiles obtained from in-situ particle measurements by the high-altitude satellites do not allow tracking the pressure variations related to the storms and substorms , because a time interval needed to do this generally exceeds the characteristic times of them . On contrary , fast movement of low-altitude satellites makes it possible to retrieve quasi-instantaneous profiles of plasma pressure along the satellite trajectory , using the fluxes of precipitating particles . For this study , we used the Aureol-3 satellite data for plasma pressure estimation , and the IGRF , Tsyganenko 2001 and Tsyganenko 2004 storm time geomagnetic field models for the pressure mapping into the equatorial plane . It was found that during quiet geomagnetic condition the radial pressure profiles obtained coincide with the profiles , obtained previously from the high-altitude measurements . On the contrary , it was found that during geomagnetic storm the plasma pressure profiles became sharper ; the position of the maximum of plasma pressure corresponds to expected one for given Dst minimum ; the maximum value of inner magnetosphere static pressure correlates with the solar wind dynamic pressure . Increase in the plasma pressure profiles indicates the possibility to consider the interchange instability as one of important factors for the development of the main phase of geomagnetic storm .
