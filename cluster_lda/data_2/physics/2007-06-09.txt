0706.1325	physics.hist-ph	Possible astronomical references in the planning of the Great Hopewell Road	The possible existence of astronomical references in the planning of the so-called Great Hopewell Road , a 90 Kilometres straight road composed of two parallel earthen embankments which , according to recent surveys , likely connected the Hopewell ceremonial centres of Newark and Chillicothe , Ohio , are investigated . It turns out that a very peculiar , although simple , set of astronomical alignments took place in connection with the road during possible periods of its construction . The possibility of a non-fortuitous connection is thus proposed and analysed .
