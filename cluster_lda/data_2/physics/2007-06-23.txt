It has been shown that the gravitation field with spherical symmetry can lead to a change of birefringence in anisotropic media .

0706.3621	physics.gen-ph	Climate Change : The Sun 's Role	The sun 's role in the earth 's recent warming remains controversial even though there is a good deal of evidence to support the thesis that solar variations are a very significant factor in driving climate change both currently and in the past . This precis lays out the background and data needed to understand the basic scientific argument behind the contention that variations in solar output have a significant impact on current changes in climate . It also offers a simple , phenomenological approach for estimating the actual-as opposed to model dependent-magnitude of the sun 's influence on climate .
