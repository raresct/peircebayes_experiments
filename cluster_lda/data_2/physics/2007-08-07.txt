0708.0925	physics.soc-ph	Emergence of communities in weighted networks	Topology and weights are closely related in weighted complex networks and this is reflected in their modular structure . We present a simple network model where the weights are generated dynamically and they shape the developing topology . By tuning a model parameter governing the importance of weights , the resulting networks undergo a gradual structural transition from a module free topology to one with communities . The model also reproduces many features of large social networks , including the `` weak links '' property .

The teaching of special relativity , however , still follows its presentation as it unfolded historically , trying to convince the audience of this teaching that Newtonian physics is natural but incorrect and special relativity is its paradoxical but correct amendment . I argue in this article in favor of logical instead of historical trend in teaching of relativity and that special relativity is neither paradoxical nor correct ( in the absolute sense of the nineteenth century ) but the most natural and expected description of the real space-time around us valid for all practical purposes . This last circumstance constitutes a profound mystery of modern physics better known as the cosmological constant problem .
0708.0931	physics.atom-ph	Spectroscopy of the a^3\Sigma_u^+ state and the coupling to the X^1\Sigma_g^+ state of K_2	We report on high resolution Fourier-transform spectroscopy of fluorescence to the a^3\Sigma_u^+ state excited by two-photon or two-step excitation from the X^1\Sigma_g^+ state to the 2^3\Pi_g state in the molecule K_2 . These spectroscopic data are combined with recent results of Feshbach resonances and two-color photoassociation spectra for deriving the potential curves of X^1\Sigma_g^+ and a^3\Sigma_u^+ up to the asymptote . The precise relative position of the triplet levels with respect of the singlet levels was achieved by including the excitation energies from the X^1\Sigma_g^+ state to the 2^3\Pi_g state and down to the a^3\Sigma_u^+ state in the simultaneous fit of both potentials . The derived precise potential curves allow for reliable modeling of cold collisions of pairs of potassium atoms in their ^2S ground state .
0708.0958	physics.soc-ph physics.data-an	Role models for complex networks	We present a framework for automatically decomposing ( `` block-modeling '' ) the functional classes of agents within a complex network . These classes are represented by the nodes of an image graph ( `` block model '' ) depicting the main patterns of connectivity and thus functional roles in the network . Using a first principles approach , we derive a measure for the fit of a network to any given image graph allowing objective hypothesis testing . From the properties of an optimal fit , we derive how to find the best fitting image graph directly from the network and present a criterion to avoid overfitting . The method can handle both two-mode and one-mode data , directed and undirected as well as weighted networks and allows for different types of links to be dealt with simultaneously . It is non-parametric and computationally efficient . The concepts of structural equivalence and modularity are found as special cases of our approach . We apply our method to the world trade network and analyze the roles individual countries play in the global economy .
0708.0988	physics.ed-ph	The role of the two postulates of special relativity	Students are often mystified by the reasoning that leads from the postulates of special relativity to the requirement of covariance . This is partly due to the lack of transparency resulting from the failure to clearly separate the roles the postulates of the constancy of the speed of light and of relativity play . Their roles are elucidated here by mainly geometric means . Finally some standard derivations found in textbooks are analyzed in order to sort out the basic physical ingredients .
0708.1008	physics.gen-ph	An Isotropic Metric	An isotropic metric for a black hole and a better vacuum condition \nabla^2 V_G =0 are presented which yield distinct terms for the energy densities of ordinary matter and gravitational fields in the Einstein tensor ( G^44 =-g^2 ( 2\nabla^2 V_G + ( \nabla V_G ) ^2 ) ) This model resolves an inconsistency between electromagnetism and gravity in the calculation of field energy . Resolution of this inconsistency suggests a slight modification of the Einstein equation to gG^\mu\nu = 8\pi G T^\mu\nu .
0708.1012	physics.atom-ph	Spin-exchange relaxation free magnetometry with Cs vapor	We describe a Cs atomic magnetometer operating in the spin-exchange relaxation-free ( SERF ) regime . With a vapor cell temperature of $ 103^\circ\rm { C } $ we achieve intrinsic magnetic resonance widths $ \Delta B=17 { \rm \mu G } $ corresponding to an electron spin-relaxation rate of $ 300 { \rm s^ { -1 } } $ when the spin-exchange rate is $ \Gamma_ { SE } =14000 { \rm s^ { -1 } } $ . We also observe an interesting narrowing effect due to diffusion . Signal-to-noise measurements yield a sensitivity of about $ 400\thinspace { \rm pG/\sqrt { Hz } } $ . Based on photon shot noise , we project a sensitivity of $ 40 { \rm pG/\sqrt { Hz } } $ . A theoretical optimization of the magnetometer indicates sensitivities on the order of $ 2 { \rm pG/\sqrt { Hz } } $ should be achievable in a $ 1 { \rm cm^3 } $ volume . Because Cs has a higher saturated vapor pressure than other alkali metals , SERF magnetometers using Cs atoms are particularly attractive in applications requiring lower temperatures .
0708.1031	physics.optics physics.comp-ph	Perturbation theory for anisotropic dielectric interfaces , and application to sub-pixel smoothing of discretized numerical methods	We derive a correct first-order perturbation theory in electromagnetism for cases where an interface between two anisotropic dielectric materials is slightly shifted . Most previous perturbative methods give incorrect results for this case , even to lowest order , because of the complicated discontinuous boundary conditions on the electric field at such an interface . Our final expression is simply a surface integral , over the material interface , of the continuous field components from the unperturbed structure . The derivation is based on a `` localized '' coordinate-transformation technique , which avoids both the problem of field discontinuities and the challenge of constructing an explicit coordinate transformation by taking a limit in which a coordinate perturbation is infinitesimally localized around the boundary . Not only is our result potentially useful in evaluating boundary perturbations , e.g . from fabrication imperfections , in highly anisotropic media such as many metamaterials , but it also has a direct application in numerical electromagnetism . In particular , we show how it leads to a sub-pixel smoothing scheme to ameliorate staircasing effects in discretized simulations of anisotropic media , in such a way as to greatly reduce the numerical errors compared to other proposed smoothing schemes .
