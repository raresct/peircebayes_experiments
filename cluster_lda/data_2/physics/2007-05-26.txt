0705.3883	physics.gen-ph	Comment on `` Cyclotron resonance study of the electron and hole velocity in graphene monolayers ''	In this comment it is pointed out that the electron velocity of the same order as observed in graphene had been measured in GaAs submicron devices long ago . Particle- antiparticle asymmetry related with electron and hole effective masses in graphene seems puzzling as hole in a condensed matter system can not be treated as anti-electron . It is argued that there should be a universal electrodynamics for QHE and superconductivity . In this context attention is drawn to the new approach based on massless electron and the interpretation that magnetic field represents angular momentum of the photon fluid . Measurement of electron velocity in graphene and GaAs in parallel is suggested for testing the massless electrodynamics .

The transition from an axisymmetric stationary flow to time-dependent flows is studied using nonlinear simulations , linear stability analysis and bifurcation theory . At a Rayleigh number near 25,000 , the axisymmetric flow becomes unstable to standing or travelling azimuthal waves . The standing waves are slightly unstable to travelling waves . This scenario is identified as a Hopf bifurcation in a system with O ( 2 ) symmetry .
