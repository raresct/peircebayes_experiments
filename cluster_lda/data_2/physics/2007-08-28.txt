0708.3743	physics.gen-ph	The Universe expansion and Energy problems	In this paper we construct a physical modelization of the universe expansion . The universe then reduces to a Riemannian space $ 0.2cm $ $ ( B ( O , R ( t ) ) , g_t ) $ , where $ R ( t ) \sim t $ for $ t \gg $ 0 , and $ g_t $ is a time - dependent Riemannian metric which reflects and characterizes the dynamical matter - energy distribution $ E_t ( X ) $ on $ B ( O , R ( t ) ) $ according to the Mach - Einstein principle . Our model allows us to resolve several major problems of Physics . It is consistent in the sense that all Newtonian and classical physical laws are valid as particular cases in classical situations . Moreover , our model permits to recover some confirmed principles and postulates such as the famous Einstein 's relationship $ E = mc^2 $ and to specify some approximate results of modern Physics . After showing , rigorously , the deficiency of the second part of the special relativity second postulate and after specifying the role of the wave quantum Mechanics and the quantum Statistics , we adapt the Einstein's general relativity theory and the ( Einstein - de Sitter - Friedmann ) homogeneous isotropic cosmology to our setting . This readaptation allows us to determine the age , the size and the total energy of our universe and to prove that only the total energy E , the electromagnetic constant $ ke^2 $ and the speed of light c are time - independent universal constants . The other fundamental constants of Physics ( such as G , $ \bar { h } $ , $ K_B 0.05cm T $ , $ \alpha $ ... ) are indeed time - dependent and naturally related to the previous ones . Consequently , we realize the unification of all Physics ' domains The expanding universe is so reduced to four basic elements ( E , c , $ ke^2 $ , t ) and dynamically described by a ( reviewed ) general relativity theory .
0708.3756	physics.class-ph	Discussion of `` Second order topological sensitivity analysis '' by J. Rocha de Faria et al	The article by J. Rocha de Faria et al . under discussion is concerned with the evaluation of the perturbation undergone by the potential energy of a domain $ \Omega $ ( in a 2-D , scalar Laplace equation setting ) when a disk $ B_ { \epsilon } $ of small radius $ \epsilon $ centered at a given location $ \hat { \boldsymbol { x } \in\Omega $ is removed from $ \Omega $ , assuming either Neumann or Dirichlet conditions on the boundary of the small `hole ' thus created . In each case , the potential energy $ \psi ( \Omega_ { \epsilon } ) $ of the punctured domain $ \Omega_ { \epsilon } =\Omega\setminus\B_ { \epsilon } $ is expanded about $ \epsilon=0 $ so that the first two terms of the perturbation are given . The first ( leading ) term is the well-documented topological derivative of $ \psi $ . The article under discussion places , logically , its main focus on the next term of the expansion . However , it contains incorrrect results , as shown in this discussion . In what follows , equations referenced with Arabic numbers refer to those of the article under discussion .

The resulting systems allow image magnification and minimize reflection losses due to the impedance matching at the input or output boundaries . While perfect impedance matching at both surfaces can only be obtained in a system with radius-dependent magnetic permeability , we demonstrate that comparable performance can be achieved in an optimized non-magnetic design .
0708.3810	physics.gen-ph	From the Planck to the Photon Scale	Using considerations from the Quantum Zero Point Field and Thermodynamics , we show that the Planck Scale is the minimum ( maximum mass ) and the Photon Scale is the maximum ( minimum mass ) Scale in the universe . The arguments also deduce the residual cosmic energy of $ 10^ { -33 } eV $ observed lately .
0708.3827	physics.class-ph	Linear frictional forces cause orbits to neither circularize nor precess	For the undamped Kepler potential the lack of precession has historically been understood in terms of the Runge-Lenz symmetry . For the damped Kepler problem this result may be understood in terms of the generalization of Poisson structure to damped systems suggested recently by Tarasov [ 1 ] . In this generalized algebraic structure the orbit-averaged Runge-Lenz vector remains a constant in the linearly damped Kepler problem to leading order in the damping coe
0708.3834	physics.soc-ph	A simple evolutionary game with feedback between perception and reality	We study an evolutionary game of chance in which the probabilities for different outcomes ( e.g. , heads or tails ) depend on the amount wagered on those outcomes . The game is perhaps the simplest possible probabilistic game in which perception affects reality . By varying the `reality map ' , which relates the amount wagered to the probability of the outcome , it is possible to move continuously from a purely objective game in which probabilities have no dependence on wagers , to a purely subjective game in which probabilities equal the amount wagered . The reality map can reflect self-reinforcing strategies or self-defeating strategies . In self-reinforcing games , rational players can achieve increasing returns and manipulate the outcome probabilities to their advantage ; consequently , an early lead in the game , whether acquired by chance or by strategy , typically gives a persistent advantage . We investigate the game both in and out of equilibrium and with and without rational players . We introduce a method of measuring the inefficiency of the game and show that in the large time limit the inefficiency decreases slowly in its approach to equilibrium as a power law with an exponent between zero and one , depending on the subjectivity of the game .
