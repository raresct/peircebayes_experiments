0707.0091	physics.gen-ph	Unheeded pseudo solution of Dirac-Coulomb equations with an indirect transformation of functions	We open out one of incorrect solutions of the Driac equation in the Coulomb field given in a published paper . By introducing a transformation of function , the paper transformed the original radial first-order Dirac-Coulomb equation into two second-order Dirac-Coulomb equation . However , each of the second-order differential equations has differential energy eigenvalues set . The original paper wrote the two differential equations into one of forms , and then gave the distinguished energy eigenvalues . The mathematical procedure is not correct . For the same quantum system , introducing a transformation of function yields two different energy eigenvaluse , the result violates the uniqueness of solution . It actually shows that the given second-order differential equations have no solution . On the other hand , the given formal solutions of the second-order Dirac-Coulomb equations violate the conditions for determining solution . Consequently , the solutions given by the author are pseudo solution , and the corresponding energy eigenvalues set is also a pseudo eigenvalues set .

For a 7-km link installed in an urban environment , the transfer instability is $ 6 \times 10^ { -18 } $ at 1-s . The excess phase noise of 0.15 rad , integrated from 8 mHz to 25 MHz , yields a total timing jitter of 0.085 fs . A 32-km link achieves similar performance . Using frequency combs at each end of the coherent-transfer fiber link , a heterodyne beat between two independent ultrastable lasers , separated by 3.5 km and 163 THz , achieves a 1-Hz linewidth .

The results are presented both as functions of the Rayleigh number ( Ra ) up to $ 10^8 $ ( for fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom plates ) and as functions of '' non-Oberbeck-Boussinesqness '' or `` NOBness '' ( $ \Delta $ ) up to 50 K ( for fixed Ra ) . For this large NOBness the center temperature $ T_c $ is more than 5 K larger than the arithmetic mean temperature $ T_m $ between top and bottom plate and only weakly depends on Ra . To physically account for the NOB deviations of the Nusselt numbers from its Oberbeck-Boussinesq values , we apply the decomposition of $ Nu_ { NOB } /Nu_ { OB } $ into the product of two effects , namely first the change in the sum of the top and bottom thermal BL thicknesses , and second the shift of the center temperature $ T_c $ as compared to $ T_m $ . While for water the origin of the $ Nu $ deviation is totally dominated by the second effect ( cf . Ahlers et al. , J. Fluid Mech . 569 , pp . 409 ( 2006 ) ) for glycerol the first effect is dominating , in spite of the large increase of $ T_c $ as compared to $ T_m $ .
0707.0136	physics.gen-ph	Fractal Relativity , Generalized Noether Theorem and New Research of Space-Time	First , let the fractal dimension D=n ( integer ) +d ( decimal ) , so the fractal dimensional matrix was represented by a usual matrix adds a special decimal row ( column ) . We researched that mathematics , for example , the fractal dimensional linear algebra , and physics may be developed to fractal and the complex dimension extended from fractal . From this the fractal relativity is discussed , which connects with self-similarity Universe and the extensive quantum theory . The space dimension has been extended from real number to superreal and complex number . Combining the quaternion , etc. , the high dimensional time is introduced . Such the vector and irreversibility of time are derived . Then the fractal dimensional time is obtained , and space and time possess completely symmetry . It may be constructed preliminarily that the higher dimensional , fractal , complex and supercomplex space-time theory covers all . We propose a generalized Noether theorem , and irreversibility of time should correspond to non-conservation of a certain quantity . Resumed reversibility of time and possible decrease of entropy are discussed . Finally , we obtain the quantitative relations between energy-mass and space-time , which is consistent with the space-time uncertainty relation in string theory .
