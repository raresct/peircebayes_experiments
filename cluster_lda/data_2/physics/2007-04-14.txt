The detector provides a measurement of the coordinates and the energy of scattered photons in the GeV energy range with resolutions of 5 mm and 6 % /\sqrt ( E { \gamma } [ GeV ] ) . Features of both the detector design and its performance in the high luminosity environment during the experiment are presented .
0704.1876	physics.gen-ph	Stars and the holographic upper bound on gravitational action	The holographic upper bound on entropy is applied to the gravitational action associated with the non-relativistic contraction of a nebula . A critical radius is identified , as a function of the initial radius and mass , for which the number of bits associated with the action would equal the maximum number of bits allowed to the body . The gravitational action of a typical star approximately saturates the holographic bound , perhaps suggesting a physical link between holographic principles and astrophysical processes .

Using the simplest possible finite-difference implementation of this approach , we obtain both agreement with past results for cylinder-plate geometries , and also present results for new geometries . In particular , we examine a piston-like problem involving two dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls , in two and three dimensions , respectively , and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic changes in the force due to these lateral walls .
