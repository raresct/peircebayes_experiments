0711.1639	physics.soc-ph	The Kolkata Paise Restaurant Problem and Resource Utilization	We study the dynamics of the `` Kolkata Paise Restaurant problem '' . The problem is the following : In each period , N agents have to choose between N restaurants . Agents have a common ranking of the restaurants . Restaurants can only serve one customer . When more than one customer arrives at the same restaurant , one customer is chosen at random and is served ; the others do not get the service . We first introduce the one-shot versions of the Kolkata Paise Restaurant problem which we call one-shot KPR games . We then study the dynamics of the Kolkata Paise Restaurant problem ( which is a repeated game version of any given one shot KPR game ) for large N. For statistical analysis , we explore the long time steady state behavior . In many such models with myopic agents we get under-utilization of resources , that is , we get a lower aggregate payoff compared to the social optimum . We study a number of myopic strategies , focusing on the average occupation fraction of restaurants .

The results of calculation show that original DOS peaks split into two and the positions of peaks can be modulated periodically by controlling the magnetic field . We attribute this phenomenon to the interaction between the molecular orbital magnetic momentum and the magnetic field . Generally , this effect is obscure for a usual structure but obvious for the cyclic molecules .
0711.1652	physics.soc-ph	Cooperation enhanced by the difference between interaction and learning neighborhoods for evolutionary spatial prisoner 's dilemma games	We study an evolutionary prisoner 's dilemma game with two layered graphs , where the lower layer is the physical infrastructure on which the interactions are taking place and the upper layer represents the connections for the strategy adoption ( learning ) mechanism . This system is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations and an extended pair-approximation method . We consider the average density of cooperators in the stationary state for a fixed interaction graph , while varying the number of edges in the learning graph . According to the Monte Carlo simulations , the cooperation is modified substantially in a way resembling a coherence-resonance-like behavior when the number of learning edges is increased . This behavior is reproduced by the analytical results .
0711.1653	physics.soc-ph	Effects of inhomogeneous influence of individuals on an order-disorder transition in opinion dynamics	We study the effects of inhomogeneous influence of individuals on collective phenomena . We focus analytically on a typical model of the majority rule , applied to the completely connected agents . Two types of individuals $ A $ and $ B $ with different influence activity are introduced . The individuals $ A $ and $ B $ are distributed randomly with concentrations $ \nu $ and $ 1-\nu $ at the beginning and fixed further on . Our main result is that the location of the order-disorder transition is affected due to the introduction of the inhomogeneous influence . This result highlights the importance of inhomogeneous influence between different types of individuals during the process of opinion updating .
0711.1654	physics.soc-ph	Effects of inhomogeneous activity of players and noise on cooperation in spatial public goods games	We study the public goods game in the noisy case by considering the players with inhomogeneous activity teaching on a square lattice . It is shown that the introduction of the inhomogeneous activity of teaching of the players can remarkably promote cooperation . By investigating the effects of noise on cooperative behavior in detail , we find that the variation of cooperator density $ \rho_C $ with the noise parameter $ \kappa $ displays several different behaviors : $ \rho_C $ monotonically increases ( decreases ) with $ \kappa $ ; $ \rho_C $ firstly increases ( decreases ) with $ \kappa $ and then it decreases ( increases ) monotonically after reaching its maximum ( minimum ) value , which depends on the amount of the multiplication factor $ r $ , on whether the system is homogeneous or inhomogeneous , and on whether the adopted updating is synchronous or asynchronous . These results imply that the noise plays an important and nontrivial role in the evolution of cooperation .
0711.1655	physics.soc-ph	Congestion diffusion and decongestion strategy in networked traffic	We study the information traffic in Barab\'asi-Albert scale free networks wherein each node has finite queue length to store the packets . It is found that in the case of shortest path routing strategy the networks undergo a first order phase transition i.e. , from a free flow state to full congestion sate , with the increasing of the packet generation rate . We also incorporate random effect ( namely random selection of a neighbor to deliver packets ) as well as a control method ( namely the packet-dropping strategy of the congested nodes after some delay time $ T $ ) into the routing protocol to test the traffic capacity of the heterogeneous networks . It is shown that there exists optimal value of $ T $ for the networks to achieve the best handling ability , and the presence of appropriate random effect also attributes to the performance of the networks .

These ranges can be controlled by the application of a dc electric field , and depend on both the magnitude and the direction of the dc field . Thus , surface-wave propagation can be electrically controlled by exploiting the Pockels effect .

As such it serves as an introduction to the articles on particular aspects of electric discharges contained in this book , in particular in the chapters on lightning and the violent discharges which in the recent two decades have been observed to take place in Earth 's upper atmosphere . In addition of briefly reviewing the early history of gas discharge physics we discuss the main parameters affecting violent atmospheric discharges like collision frequency , mean free path and critical electric field strength . Any discharge current in the atmosphere is clearly carried only by electrons . Above the lower bound of the mesosphere the electrons must be considered magnetized with the conductivity becoming a tensor . Moreover , the collisional mean free path in the upper atmosphere becomes relatively large which lowers the critical electric field there and more easily enables discharges than at lower altitudes . Finally we briefly mention the relation of such discharges as sources for wave emission .
0711.1673	physics.gen-ph	Universal relaxation times for electron and nucleon gases	In this paper we calculate the universal relaxation times for electron and nucleon fermionic gases . We argue that the universal relaxation time tau ( i ) is equal tau ( i ) =h/m square v ( i ) where v ( i ) =alpha ( i ) c and alpha ( 1 ) =0.15 for nucleon gas and alpha ( 2 ) =1/137 for electron gas , c=light velocity . With the universal relaxation time we formulate the thermal Proca equation for fermionic gases . Key words : universal relaxation time , thermal universal Proca equation .
0711.1676	physics.plasm-ph	Gibbsian theory of power law distributions	It is shown that power law phase space distributions describe marginally stable Gibbsian equilibria far from thermal equilibrium which are expected to occur in collisionless plasmas containing fully developed quasi-stationary turbulence . Gibbsian theory is extended on the fundamental level to statistically dependent subsystems introducing an `ordering parameter' $ \kappa $ . Particular forms for the entropy and partition functions are derived with super-additive ( non-extensive ) entropy , and a redefinition of temperature in such systems is given .
0711.1684	physics.class-ph	Saturated absorption spectroscopy : elimination of crossover resonances by use of a nanocell	It is demonstrated that velocity selective optical pumping/saturation resonances of reduced absorption in a Rb vapor nanocell with thickness \textit { L= } $ \lambda $ , 2 $ \lambda $ , and 3 $ \lambda $ ( resonant wavelength $ \lambda $ = 780 nm ) allow the complete elimination of crossover ( CO ) resonances . We observe well pronounced resonances corresponding to the F $ _ { g } =3 $ $ \to $ F $ _ { e } =2,3,4 $ hyperfine transitions of the $ ^ { 85 } $ Rb D $ _ { 2 } $ line with linewidths close to the natural width . A small CO resonance located midway between F $ _ { g } =3 $ $ \to $ F $ _ { e } =3 $ and F $ _ { g } =3 $ $ \to $ F $ _ { e } =4 $ transitions appears only for \textit { L } = 4 $ \lambda $ . The D $ _ { 2 } $ line ( $ \lambda $ = 852 nm ) in a Cs nanocell exhibits a similar behavior . From the amplitude ratio of the CO and VSOP resonances it is possible to determine the thickness of the column of alkali vapor in the range of 1 - 1000 $ \mu $ m . The absence of CO resonances for nanocells with $ L \sim \lambda $ is attractive for frequency reference application and for studying transitions between Zeeman sublevels in external magnetic fields .
