0706.0313	physics.gen-ph	Quasi-periodic oscillations , charge and the gravitomagnetic theory	A new model for the explanation of the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations ( QPOs ) in pulsars , black holes and white dwarfs is presented . Three circular tori are assumed to be present around the star : an inner torus with charge $ Q_i $ , an outer torus with charge $ Q_o $ and a torus with electrically neutral mass $ m_m $ in the middle , whereas the star bears a charge $ Q_s $ ( $ Q_o $ and $ Q_s $ have the same sign , $ Q_i $ the opposite one ) . The frequency $ \nu_m $ of the mass current is approximately given by the Kepler frequency , whereas the frequencies of $ Q_i $ and $ Q_o $ , $ \nu_i $ and $ \nu_o $ , respectively , are calculated from classical mechanics and Coulomb 's law . For the explanation of the low frequency QPOs in pulsars and black holes a special interpretation of the gravitomagnetic theory may be essential . From the latter theory four new gravitomagnetic precession frequencies are deduced , which may be identified with the observed low frequency QPOs . Predictions of the presented model are compared with observed high frequency and low frequency QPOs of the pulsars SAX J1808.4 -- 3658 , XTE J1807 -- 294 , IGR J00291+5934 , SGR 1806 -- 20 and the black hole XTE J1550 -- 564 . In addition , charge flow near the pole of pulsars may explain frequency drift of burst oscillations . Moreover , charge flow at the equator of SAX J1808.4 -- 3658 may be the cause of the enigmatic 410 kHz QPO . Furthermore , the Lense-Thirring frequency is discussed and a modified formula is compared with data of the pulsars . Contrary to pulsars and black holes , the low frequency QPOs of white dwarfs might be attributed to electromagnetic precession frequencies , deduced in this work . Predictions are compared with data of the dwarf nova VW Hyi .
0706.0317	physics.gen-ph	Are We Alone in the Multiverse ?	It has long been proposed that black hole singularities bounce to deliver daughter universes . Here the consequences of such a scenario are explored in light of Lee Smolin 's hypothesis of Cosmological Natural Selection and Weak Anthropic Principle . The explorations lead towards the answer to the question Are We Alone in the Multiverse ?
0706.0318	physics.gen-ph	Exact Vacuum Solutions to the Einstein Equation	In this paper , we present a framework for getting a series of exact vacuum solutions to the Einstein equation . This procedure of resolution is based on a canonical form of the metric . According to this procedure , the Einstein equation can be reduced to some 2-dimensional Laplace-like equations or rotation and divergence equations , which are much convenient for the resolution .

A complex Ginzburg-Landau equation , a Newell-Whitehead-type equation , and an equation of the $ \phi^4 $ type , respectively , were obtained . Analytic expressions for the coefficients of these equations and their various asymptotic forms are presented . In the case of Hopf bifurcation for low and high frequencies , the amplitude equation reduces to a perturbed nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger equation . In the high-frequency limit , structures of the type of '' dark '' solitons are characteristic of the examined physical system .
