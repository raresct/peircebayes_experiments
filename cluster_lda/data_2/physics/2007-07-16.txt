OPTOTEACH is the first POF-WDM teaching system , specifically designed to cover a multitude of lab experiments in the field of optical communication technology . It is illustrated , how this lab system is supplemented by a newly developed optical teaching software - `` OPTOSOFT '' - and how the combination of system and software creates a unique augmented learning environment . The paper details , how the didactic concept for the software was conceptualised and introduces the latest beta version . OPTOSOFT is specifically designed not only as an attachment to OPTOTEACH , it also allows students to rehearse various aspects of theoretical optics and experience a fully interactive and feature-rich self-learning environment . The paper further details the first experiences educators at Harz University have made working with the lab system as well as the teaching software . So far , the augmented learning concept was received mostly positive , although there is some potential for further optimisation concerning integration and pacing of various interactive modules .

By means of saturation absorption spectroscopy we have measured the hyperfine structure and rates of two nearly closed cycling transitions from the ground state $ 4\textrm { f } ^ { 13 } 6\textrm { s } ^2 ( ^2\textrm { F } _0 ) ( J_g=7/2 ) $ to upper states $ 4\textrm { f } ^ { 12 } ( ^3\textrm { H } _5 ) 5\textrm { d } _ { 3/2 } 6\textrm { s } ^2 ( J_e=9/2 ) $ at 410.6 nm and $ 4\textrm { f } ^ { 12 } ( ^3\textrm { F } _4 ) 5\textrm { d } _ { 5/2 } 6\textrm { s } ^2 ( J_e=9/2 ) $ at 420.4 nm and evaluated the life times of the excited levels as 15.9 ( 8 ) ns and 48 ( 6 ) ns respectively . Decay rates from these levels to neighboring opposite-parity levels are evaluated by means of Hartree-Fock calculations . We conclude , that the strong transition at 410.6 nm has an optical leak rate of less then $ 2\cdot10^ { -5 } $ and can be used for efficient laser cooling of $ ^ { 169 } $ Tm from a thermal atomic beam . The hyperfine structure of two other even-parity levels which can be excited from the ground state at 409.5 nm and 418.9 nm is also measured by the same technique . In addition we give a calculated value of $ 7 ( 2 ) $ s $ ^ { -1 } $ for the rate of magnetic-dipole transition at 1.14 $ \mu $ m between the fine structure levels $ ( J_g=7/2 ) \leftrightarrow ( J'_g=5/2 ) $ of the ground state which can be considered as a candidate for applications in atomic clocks .

We discover the existence of a maximum allowed topological charge for such vortex solitons to be stable on propagation : Only vortex-ring solitons with topological charge m < =2 are found to be stable . This remarkable result holds independently of the radius of the sample .
0707.2338	physics.gen-ph	Lorentz transformation by mimicking the Lorentz transformation	We show that starting with the fact that special relativity theory is concerned with a distortion of the observed length of a moving rod , without mentioning if it is a `` contraction '' or `` dilation '' , we can derive the Lorentz transformations for the spacetime coordinates of the same event . This derivation is based on expressing the length of the moving rod as a sum of components with all the lengths involved in this summation being measured by the observers of the same inertial reference frame .
0707.2359	physics.atom-ph	Manufacturing a thin wire electrostatic trap ( TWIST ) for ultracold polar molecules	We present a detailed description on how to build a Thin WIre electroStatic Trap ( TWIST ) for ultracold polar molecules . It is the first design of an electrostatic trap that can be superimposed directly onto a magneto optical trap ( MOT ) . We can thus continuously produce ultracold polar molecules via photoassociation from a two species MOT and instantaneously trap them in the TWIST without the need for complex transfer schemes . Despite the spatial overlap of the TWIST and the MOT , the two traps can be operated and optimized completely independently due to the complementary nature of the utilized trapping mechanisms .
0707.2370	physics.plasm-ph	Temperature Equilibration Rate with Fermi-Dirac Statistics	We calculate the electron-ion temperature equilibration rate in a fully ionized , weakly to moderately coupled plasma , using an exact treatment of the Fermi-Dirac electrons . The temperature is sufficiently high so that the quantum-mechanical Born approximation to the scattering is valid . At the heart of this calculation lies the method of dimensional continuation , a technique that we borrow from quantum field theory and use in a novel fashion to regulate the kinetic equations in a consistent manner . We can then perform a systematic perturbation expansion and thereby obtain a finite first-principles result to leading and next-to-leading order . Unlike model building , this systematic calculation yields an estimate of its own error and thus prescribes its domain of applicability . The calculational error is small for a weakly to moderately coupled plasma , for which our result is nearly exact . It should also be emphasized that our calculation becomes unreliable for a strongly coupled plasma , where the perturbative expansion that we employ breaks down , and one must then utilize model building and computer simulations . Besides providing new and potentially useful results , we use this calculation as an opportunity to explain the method of dimensional continuation in a pedagogical fashion . Interestingly , in the regime of relevance for many inertial confinement fusion experiments , the degeneracy corrections are comparable in size to the subleading quantum correction below the Born approximation . For consistency , we therefore present this subleading quantum-to-classical transition correction in addition to the degeneracy correction .

In this paper we show that the problem of finding a partition maximizing the modularity of a given graph G can be reduced to a minimum weighted cut problem on a complete graph with the same vertices as G. We then show that the resulted minimum cut problem can be efficiently solved with existing software for graph partitioning and that our algorithm finds clusterings of a better quality and much faster than the existing clustering algorithms .
0707.2426	physics.gen-ph	Interpretation of relativistic , transverse , and longitudinal mass using the Lorentz transformation of reference time : Explanation of time dilation via spherical light clock	An interpretation of the inertial mass increase due to an object 's velocity which is derived from the theory of special relativity is discussed . A Lorentz transformation of the reference time causes the inertial mass increase . It is assumed that the real physical phenomenon that occurs is an expansion of the reference time by a Lorentz transformation ( that is , a dilation of time ) . Only the reference time is assumed to be variant , which causes relativistic mass . Time dilation is real . Relativistic mass originates in a Lorentz transformation of reference time .
