The historical sketch of studying of radiation damage failure of carbon targets under ion bombardment is presented . The simple model of evaporation of a target by an intensive pulsing beam is supposed . Stripper foils lifetimes in the nonstationary intense particle can be described by two failure mechanisms : radiation damage accumulation and evaporation of target . At the maximal temperatures less than 2500K the radiation damage are dominated ; at temperatures above 2500K the mechanism of evaporation of a foil prevails . The proposed approach has been applied to the discription of behaviour of stripper foils in the BNL linac and SNS conditions .
0705.3703	physics.ins-det	Branching Transport Model of Alkali-Halide Scintillators	We measure the time dependence of the scintillator light-emission pulses in NaI ( Tl ) crystals at different temperatures , after activation by gamma rays . We confirm that there are two main nonexponential components to the time decay and find that their amplitude ratio shows Arrhenius temperature dependence . We explain these nonexponential components as arising from two competing mechanisms of carrier transport to the Tl activation levels . The total light output of the NaI ( Tl ) detectors shows a linear temperature dependence explained by our model .

Assuming linear variation with time we can compare different results . From the quasar absorption spectra : $ \dot { \mu } /\mu= ( 1 \pm 3 ) \times 10^ { -16 } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ . A combination of this result and the atomic clock results gives the best limt on variation of $ \alpha $ : $ \dot { \alpha } /\alpha= ( -0.8 \pm 0.8 ) \times 10^ { -16 } $ yr $ ^ { -1 } $ . The Oklo natural reactor gives the best limit on the variation of $ m_s/\Lambda_ { QCD } $ where $ m_s $ is the strange quark mass . Huge enhancement of the relative variation effects happens in transitions between close atomic , molecular and nuclear energy levels . We suggest several new cases where the levels are very narrow . Large enhancement of the variation effects is also possible in cold atomic and molecular collisions near Feshbach resonance . Massive bodies ( stars or galaxies ) can also affect physical constants . They have large scalar charge $ S $ proportional to number of particles which produces a Coulomb-like scalar field $ U=S/r $ . This leads to a variation of the fundamental constants proportional to the gravitational potential , e.g . $ \delta \alpha/ \alpha = k_\alpha \delta ( GM/ r c^2 ) $ . We compare different manifestations of this effect.The strongest limit $ k_\alpha +0.17 k_e= ( -3.5\pm 6 ) \times 10^ { -7 } $ .
0705.3722	physics.gen-ph	Zero-point radiation and the Big Bang	This paper develops a cosmological hypothesis based on the following propositions : 1 . Zero-point radiation derives from quantic fluctuations in space , and the wavelength of its photons with the greatest energy is inversely proportional to the curvature of space . 2 . The Universe began as the breaking in of photons of extremely high energy contained in the 3-dimensional surface : $ w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2_i $ , whose radius has continued to expand at the speed of ligth since its origin at $ t=0 $ . 3 . The wavelength of the photons is quantized and the quantum of wavelength is invariable . These propositions imply that the value of the total energy of the zero-point radiation in the Universe remains constant and the condition $ w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ( R_i + ct ) ^2 = R_u^2 $ determines that every point in our space is subject to a tension whose intensity $ i $ is proportional to the curvature $ 1/R_u $ . Any increase of $ R_u $ implies a decrease in $ i $ and consequently an energy flow which translates into an expansive force . Therefore , the Universe will expand indefinitely : no Big Crunch is possible . If the initial radius of the Universe $ R_i $ has been smaller than the Schwarzschild radius , $ R_s $ , which corresponds to the total mass of the Universe , $ M_u $ , the generation of matter would have lasted for thousands of millions of years . Generation of matter over short periods would have required values for $ R_i $ of thousands of millions of light years .
0705.3737	physics.plasm-ph	When can Fokker-Planck Equation describe anomalous or chaotic transport ?	The Fokker-Planck Equation , applied to transport processes in fusion plasmas , can model several anomalous features , including uphill transport , scaling of confinement time with system size , and convective propagation of externally induced perturbations . It can be justified for generic particle transport provided that there is enough randomness in the Hamiltonian describing the dynamics . Then , except for 1 degree-of-freedom , the two transport coefficients are largely independent . Depending on the statistics of interest , the same dynamical system may be found diffusive or dominated by its L\ ' { e } vy flights .

By formulating the scattering theory in the crystal momentum basis , one can exploit the lattice symmetry and factorize the scattering problem in terms of center-of-mass and relative momentum in the reduced Brillouin zone scheme . Within a single band approximation , we can tune the position of a Feshbach resonance with the center-of-mass momentum due to the non-parabolic form of the energy band .
0705.3793	physics.atom-ph physics.gen-ph	Precision measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force in a fluid	The Casimir force , which results from the confinement of the quantum mechanical zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields , has received significant attention in recent years for its effect on micro- and nano-scale mechanical systems . With few exceptions , experimental observations have been limited to conductive bodies interacting separated by vacuum or air . However , interesting phenomena including repulsive forces are expected to exist in certain circumstances between metals and dielectrics when the intervening medium is not vacuum . In order to better understand the effect of the Casimir force in such situations and to test the robustness of the generalized Casimir-Lifshitz theory , we have performed the first precision measurements of the Casimir force between two metals immersed in a fluid . For this situation , the measured force is attractive and is approximately 80 % smaller than the force predicted by Casimir for ideal metals in vacuum . We present experimental results and find them to be consistent with Lifshitz 's theory .

The profiles measured under quite different atmospheric conditions exhibit qualitative similarity . A proper choice of the reference scales for the wind , temperature and altitude levels allow us to consider the measurement data as realizations of a random process with universal characteristics : means , the basic functions and parameters of standard distributions for transform coefficients of the Principal Component Analysis . The features of the atmospheric conditions are described by statistical characteristics of the wind-temperature ensemble of dimensional reference scales . The model can be useful for air pollution and safety in high-risk areas such as chemical and nuclear plants .
