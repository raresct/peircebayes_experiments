The discrimination capacity ( zero-variance ) of geometry appears , when at the point $ P_ { 0 } $ there are no vectors , which are equivalent to the vector $ Q_ { 0 } Q_ { 1 } $ at the point $ Q_ { 0 } $ . It is shown , that in some multivariant space-time geometries some particles of small mass may be discriminated ( i.e . either they do not exist , or their evolution is impossible ) . The possibility of some particle discrimination may appear to be important for explanation of the discrete character of mass spectrum of elementary particles .
0712.1350	physics.ins-det	Cavity BPM System Tests for the ILC Spectrometer	The main physics programme of the International Linear Collider ( ILC ) requires a measurement of the beam energy at the interaction point with an accuracy of $ 10^ { -4 } $ or better . To achieve this goal a magnetic spectrometer using high resolution beam position monitors ( BPMs ) has been proposed . This paper reports on the cavity BPM system that was deployed to test this proposal . We demonstrate sub-micron resolution and micron level stability over 20 hours for a $ 1\m $ long BPM triplet . We find micron-level stability over 1 hour for 3 BPM stations distributed over a $ 30\m $ long baseline . The understanding of the behaviour and response of the BPMs gained from this work has allowed full spectrometer tests to be carried out .

Diverse social roles emerge from the dynamics of the system : leaders are individuals getting a large payoff who are imitated by a considerable fraction of the population , conformists are unsatisfied cooperative agents that keep cooperating , and exploiters are defectors with a payoff larger than the average one obtained by cooperators . The dynamics generate a social network that can have the topology of a small world network . The network has a strong hierarchical structure in which the leaders play an essential role in sustaining a highly cooperative stable regime . But disruptions affecting leaders produce social crises described as dynamical cascades that propagate through the network .
0712.1367	physics.optics physics.hist-ph	Planck , Photon Statistics , and Bose-Einstein Condensation	The interplay between optical and statistical physics is a rich and exciting field of study . Black body radiation was the first application of photon statistics , although it was initially treated as a problem of the cavity oscillators in equilibrium with the photon field . However Planck surprisingly resisted the idea that anything physical would be quantized for a long time after he had solved the problem . We trace this development . Then , after the invention of the laser itself , it proved difficult to develop a theory of laser action that could account for photon statistics , i.e . fluctuations near threshold . This was accomplished in 1965 . After Bose-Einstein condensation was successfully achieved , the same problem arose in this case . The fluctuation problem had not been treated adequately even for the ideal Bose gas . However this problem has now been solved using the same techniques as in the theory of laser action .

We quantify : ( 1 ) The average heart rate < RR > ; ( 2 ) the SD $ \sigma_ { RR } $ and $ \sigma_ { \Delta { } RR } $ of the heartbeat intervals RR and their increments $ \Delta { } RR $ ; ( 3 ) the long-range correlations in RR as measured by the scaling exponent $ \alpha_ { RR } $ using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis ; ( 4 ) fractal linear and nonlinear properties as represented by the scaling exponents $ \alpha^ { sign } $ and $ \alpha^ { mag } $ for the time series of the sign and magnitude of $ \Delta { } RR $ ; ( 5 ) the nonlinear fractal dimension $ D ( k ) $ of $ RR $ using the Fractal Dimension Analysis . We find : ( 1 ) No significant difference in $ \left < RR\right > $ ( P > 0.05 ) ; ( 2 ) a significant difference in $ \sigma_ { RR } $ and $ \sigma_ { \Delta { } RR } $ for the Fantasia groups ( P < 10^ { -4 } ) but no significant change with age between the elderly SHHS groups ( P > 0.5 ) ; ( 3 ) no significant change in the fractal measures $ \alpha_ { RR } $ ( P > 0.15 ) , $ \alpha^ { sign } $ ( P > 0.2 ) , $ \alpha^ { mag } $ ( P > 0.3 ) , and D ( k ) with age . Our findings do not support the hypothesis that fractal linear and nonlinear characteristics of heartbeat dynamics break down with advanced age in healthy subjects . While our results indeed show a reduced SD of heartbeat fluctuations with advanced age , the inherent temporal fractal and nonlinear organization of these fluctuations remains stable .
0712.1489	physics.optics physics.comp-ph	Subwavelength Nanopatch Cavities for Semiconductor Plasmon Lasers	We propose and analyze a family of nanoscale cavities for electrically-pumped surface-emitting semiconductor lasers that use surface plasmons to provide optical mode confinement in cavities which have dimensions in the 100-300 nm range . The proposed laser cavities are in many ways nanoscale optical versions of micropatch antennas that are commonly used at microwave/RF frequencies . Surface plasmons are not only used for mode confinement but also for output beam shaping to realize single-lobe far-field radiation patterns with narrow beam waists from subwavelength size cavities . We identify the cavity modes with the largest quality factors and modal gain , and show that in the near-IR wavelength range ( 1.0-1.6 microns ) cavity losses ( including surface plasmon losses ) can be compensated by the strong mode confinement in the gain region provided by the surface plasmons themselves and the required material threshold gain values can be smaller than 700 1/cm .
