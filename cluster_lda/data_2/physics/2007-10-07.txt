The vapor equilibrium technique is used to control the soil suction ; the temperature of the cell is controlled using a thermostat bath . The isotropic pressure is applied using a volume/pressure controller that is also used to monitor the volume change of soil specimen . Preliminary experimental results showed good performance of the cell .

The density function of expenditure exhibits a fat tail that follows a power law . We observe the Pareto principle where both the top 25 % and 2 % of the customers account for 80 % and 25 % of the store 's sales , respectively . Using the Lorenz curve , the Gini coefficient is estimated to be 0.70 ; this implies a strong economic inequality .
