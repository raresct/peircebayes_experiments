Individuals under surviving pressure tend to be different from others , and correlations among them change correspondingly to the updating of their states . We show with numerical simulation that these aptitudes can contribute to group formation or speciation in social fields . Moreover , they can lead to power-law topological correlations of complex networks . By coupling updating states of nodes with variation of connections in a network , structural properties with power-laws and functions like multifractality , spontaneous ranking and evolutionary branching of node states can emerge out simultaneously from the present self-organized model of coevolutionary process .

I discuss the background instruction given , the content of the activity and some results from its use in class .
