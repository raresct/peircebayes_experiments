Case of Study : The Game of Life	In the present work , a geometrical method to generate a two dimensional random walk by means of a bidimensional Cellular Automaton is presented . We illustrate it by means of Conway 's Game of Life with periodical borders , with a large lattice of 3000 x 3000 cells . The obtained random walk is of character anomalous , and its projection to a one dimensional random walk is analyzed , showing that it presents some statistical properties similar to the so-called stylized facts observed in financial time series . We consider that the procedure presented here is important not only because of its simplicity , but also because it could help us to understand and shed light on the stylized facts formation mechanism .

0710.0212	physics.flu-dyn	Linear oscillations of a compressible hemispherical bubble on a solid substrate	The linear natural and forced oscillations of a hemispherical bubble on a solid substrate are under theoretical consideration . The contact line dynamics is taken into account with the Hocking condition , which eventually leads to interaction of the shape and volume oscillations . Resonant phenomena , mostly pronounced for the bubble with the fixed contact line or with the fixed contact angle , are found out . The limiting case of weakly compressible bubble is studied . The general criterion identifying whether the compressibility of a bubble can be neglected is obtained .
0710.0226	physics.gen-ph	How Far Should the Principle of Relativity Go ?	The Principle of Relativity has so far been understood as the { \it covariance } of laws of Physics with respect to a general class of reference frame transformations . That relativity , however , has only been expressed with the help of { \it one single } type of mathematical entities , namely , the scalars given by the usual continuum of the field $ \mathbb { R } $ of real numbers , or by the usual mathematical structures built upon $ \mathbb { R } $ , such as the scalars given by the complex numbers $ \mathbb { C } $ , or the vectors in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces $ \mathbb { R } ^n $ , infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces , etc . This paper argues for { \it progressing deeper and wider } in furthering the Principle of Relativity , not by mere covariance with respect to reference frames , but by studying the possible covariance with respect to a { \it large variety } of algebras of scalars which extend significantly $ \mathbb { R } $ or $ \mathbb { C } $ , variety of scalars in terms of which various theories of Physics can equally well be formulated . First directions in this regard can be found naturally in the simple Mathematics of Special Relativity , the Bell Inequalities in Quantum Mechanics , or in the considerable amount of elementary Mathematics in finite dimensional vector spaces which occurs in Quantum Computation . The large classes of algebras of scalars suggested , which contain $ \mathbb { R } $ and $ \mathbb { C } $ as particular cases , have the important feature of typically { \it no longer } being Archimedean , see Appendix , a feature which can prove to be valuable when dealing with the so called `` infinities '' in Physics . The paper has a Comment on the so called `` end of time '' .
0710.0227	physics.optics nlin.CD	A model for chaotic dielectric microresonators	We develop a random-matrix model of two-dimensional dielectric resonators which combines internal wave chaos with the deterministic Fresnel laws for reflection and refraction at the interfaces . The model is used to investigate the statistics of the laser threshold and line width ( lifetime and Petermann factor of the resonances ) when the resonator is filled with an active medium . The laser threshold decreases for increasing refractive index $ n $ and is smaller for TM polarization than for TE polarization , but is almost independent of the number of out-coupling modes $ N $ . The Petermann factor in the line width of the longest-living resonance also decreases for increasing $ n $ and scales as $ \sqrt { N } $ , but is less sensitive to polarization . For resonances of intermediate lifetime , the Petermann factor scales linearly with $ N $ . These qualitative parametric dependencies are consistent with the random-matrix theory of resonators with small openings . However , for a small refractive index where the resonators are very open , the details of the statistics become non-universal . This is demonstrated by comparison with a particular dynamical model .
0710.0273	physics.optics physics.atom-ph	Deflection of ultra slow light under gravity	Recent experiments on ultra slow light in strongly dispersive media by several research groups reporting slowing down of the optical pulses down to speeds of a few metres per second encourage us to examine the intriguing possibility of detecting a deflection or fall of the ultra slow light under Earth 's gravity , i.e. , on the laboratory length scale . In the absence of a usable general relativistic theory of light waves propagating in such a strongly dispersive optical medium in the presence of a gravitational field , we present a geometrical optics based derivation that combines { \it the effective gravitational refractive index } additively with the usual optical dispersion . It gives a deflection , or the vertical fall $ \Delta $ for a horizontal traversal $ L $ as \ [ \Delta = \frac { L^2 } { 2 } \big ( \frac { R_ { \oplus G } } { R_\oplus^2 } \big ) n_g \big ( \frac { 1 } { 1+n_g\frac { R_ { \oplus G } } { R_\oplus } } \big ) , \ ] where $ R_ { \oplus G } /R_\oplus $ is the ratio of the gravitational Earth radius ( $ R_ { \oplus G } $ ) to its geometrical radius $ R_\oplus $ , and $ n_g $ is the group refractive index of the strongly dispersive optical medium . The expression is essentailly that for the Newtonian fall of an object projected horizontally with the group speed $ v_g=c/n_g $ , and is tunable refractively through the index $ n_g $ . For $ L \sim 1 m $ and $ n_g = c/v_g \sim 10^8 $ ( corresponding to the ultra-slow pulse speed $ \sim few \times 1 ms^ { -1 } $ ) , we obtain a fall $ \Delta \sim 1 \mu m $ , that should be measurable $ - $ in particular through its sensitive dependence on the frequency that tunes $ n_g $ .
0710.0284	physics.gen-ph physics.bio-ph	A Low-temperature 1H NMR Study of H2O and D2O Associated Competitively with Immunoglobulin G in Solution	An approach has been proposed to characterize the competitive association of D2O and to study the heterogeneity of hydration water adsorbed by the protein , immunoglobulin G , using methodology for determining of non-freezing water in mixed H2O-D2O protein solutions by low-temperature 1H NMR technique . Direct data on the numbers of deuteriums adsorbed by immunoglobulin G and isothermals of water ( D2O ) sorption by the protein for solution hydration conditions were obtained . The preferential binding of D2O as well as the isotopic effect of low D2O concentrations was simply confirmed using this method . The shape of the isothermals , similar to that for polymolecular adsorption , demonstrates relative changes in the fractions of heavy water isotope bound to different groups of protein atoms on decreasing temperature in frozen solution . At -35 deg C the major fractions attached to charged and polar atomic groups appear to be related as 2/3 . The adsorption curves indicate the direct relationship of non-freezing water to interface water in protein powders .
0710.0295	physics.class-ph physics.space-ph	Equation of motion of an interstellar Bussard ramjet with radiation and mass losses	An interstellar Bussard ramjet is a spaceship using the protons of the interstellar medium in a fusion engine to produce thrust . In recent papers , it was shown that the relativistic equation of motion of an ideal ramjet and of a ramjet with radiation loss are analytical . When a mass loss appears , the limit speed of the ramjet is more strongly reduced . But , the parametric equations , in terms of the ramjet 's speed , for the position of the ramjet in the inertial frame of the interstellar medium , the time in this frame , and the proper time indicated by the clocks on board the spaceship , can still be obtained in an analytical form . The non-relativistic motion and the motion near the limit speed are studied .
0710.0307	physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph	Reconstruction of Rayleigh-Lamb dispersion spectrum based on noise obtained from an air-jet forcing	The time-domain cross-correlation of incoherent and random noise recorded by a series of passive sensors contains the impulse response of the medium between these sensors . By using noise generated by a can of compressed air sprayed on the surface of a plexiglass plate , we are able to reconstruct not only the time of flight but the whole waveforms between the sensors . From the reconstruction of the direct $ A_0 $ and $ S_0 $ waves , we derive the dispersion curves of the flexural waves , thus estimating the mechanical properties of the material without a conventional electromechanical source . The dense array of receivers employed here allow a precise frequency-wavenumber study of flexural waves , along with a thorough evaluation of the rate of convergence of the correlation with respect to the record length , the frequency , and the distance between the receivers . The reconstruction of the actual amplitude and attenuation of the impulse response is also addressed in this paper .

Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend increasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions . In this article , we survey the model validation literature and propose to formulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the process occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists . We thus offer a formal representation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model , and thereby replace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model by an adaptive process of constructive approximation . This approach is better adapted to the fuzzy , coarse-grained nature of validation . Our procedure factors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for validation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations . We illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum Mechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several concrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests : a cellular automaton model for earthquakes , an anomalous diffusion model for solar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere , and a computational fluid dynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability .

0710.0396	physics.comp-ph physics.atom-ph	Higher-order splitting algorithms for solving the nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger equation and their instabilities	Since the kinetic and the potential energy term of the real time nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger equation can each be solved exactly , the entire equation can be solved to any order via splitting algorithms . We verified the fourth-order convergence of some well known algorithms by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically . All such splitting algorithms suffer from a latent numerical instability even when the total energy is very well conserved . A detail error analysis reveals that the noise , or elementary excitations of the nonlinear Schr\ '' odinger , obeys the Bogoliubov spectrum and the instability is due to the exponential growth of high wave number noises caused by the splitting process . For a continuum wave function , this instability is unavoidable no matter how small the time step . For a discrete wave function , the instability can be avoided only for $ \dt k_ { max } ^2 { < \atop\sim } 2 \pi $ , where $ k_ { max } =\pi/\Delta x $ .

This arrangement is referred to as a woofer-tweeter system . In certain situations it may be desirable or necessary to operate the woofer DM in open-loop . We present a simple method for controlling a woofer DM in open loop provided the device behaves in an approximately linear fashion . We have tested a mirror that we believe meets our criterion , the ALPAO DM52 mirror . Using our open-loop method we fit several test Kolmogorov wavefronts with the mirror and have achieved an accuracy of approximately 25 nm rms surface deviation over the whole clear aperture , and 20 nm rms over 90 % of the aperture . We have also flattened the mirror in open loop to approximately 11 nm rms residual .
0710.0419	physics.gen-ph	Gravitational Collapse and Radiation of Grand Unified Theory	The infinite gravitational collapse of any supermassive stars should pass through an energy scale of the grand unified theory ( GUT ) . After nucleon-decays , the supermassive star will convert nearly all its mass into energy , and produce the radiation of GUT . It may probably explain some ultrahigh energy puzzles in astrophysics , for example , quasars and gamma-ray bursts ( GRB ) , etc . This is similar with a process of the Big Bang Universe with a time-reversal evolution in much smaller space scale and mass scale . In this process the star seems be a true white hole .
