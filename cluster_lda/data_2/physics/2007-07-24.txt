Our scheme alleviates the interferometric stability required by previous schemes that implemented this coherent mode summation using Mach-Zehnder-like interferometers . A symmetrical arrangement of two walk-off crystals with a half-wave plate , allows coherence control even when the laser has short temporal coherence length . We generated 14 watts of radially polarized beam from an Ytterbium fiber laser , only limited by the available fiber laser power .

This results in a larger solution space that incorporates an exact analytic solution for the non-central electric dipole potential cos ( theta ) /r^2 , which was known not to belong to the class of exactly solvable potentials . As a result , we were able to obtain an exact analytic solution of the three-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation for a charged particle in the field of a point electric dipole that could carry a nonzero net charge . This problem models the interaction of an electron with a molecule ( neutral or ionized ) that has a permanent electric dipole moment . The solution is written as a series of square integrable functions that support a tridiagonal matrix representation for the angular and radial components of the wave operator . Moreover , this solution is for all energies , the discrete ( for bound states ) as well as the continuous ( for scattering states ) . The expansion coefficients of the radial and angular components of the wavefunction are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recursion relations . For the Coulomb-free case , where the molecule is neutral , we calculate critical values for its dipole moment below which no electron capture is allowed . These critical values are obtained not only for the ground state , where it agrees with already known results , but also for excited states as well .
0707.3511	physics.bio-ph	Continuous or discrete attractors in neural circuits ? A self-organized switch at maximal entropy	A recent experiment suggests that neural circuits may alternatively implement continuous or discrete attractors , depending on the training set up . In recurrent neural network models , continuous and discrete attractors are separately modeled by distinct forms of synaptic prescriptions ( learning rules ) . Here , we report a solvable network model , endowed with Hebbian synaptic plasticity , which is able to learn either discrete or continuous attractors , depending on the frequency of presentation of stimuli and on the structure of sensory coding . A continuous attractor is learned when experience matches sensory coding , i.e . when the distribution of experienced stimuli matches the distribution of preferred stimuli of neurons . In that case , there is no processing of sensory information and neural activity displays maximal entropy . If experience goes beyond sensory coding , processing is initiated and the continuous attractor is destabilized into a set of discrete attractors .

We experimentally demonstrate this technique , applying it to the characterization of controlled flows produced by a set of birefringent spheres spinning due to the transfer of light angular momentum . Unlike the previous techniques , this method is able to distinguish between a singular point in a complex flow and the absence of flow at all ; furthermore it permits us to characterize the stability of the singular point .

Part II : An application to El Nino	The spatial coherence of a measured variable ( e.g . temperature or pressure ) is often studied to determine the regions where this variable varies the most or to find teleconnections , i.e . correlations between specific regions . While usual methods to find spatial patterns , such as Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) , are constrained by linear symmetries , the dependence of variables such as temperature or pressure at different locations is generally nonlinear . In particular , large deviations from the sample mean are expected to be strongly affected by such nonlinearities . Here we apply a newly developed nonlinear technique ( Maxima of Cumulant Function , MCF ) for the detection of typical spatial patterns that largely deviate from the mean . In order to test the technique and to introduce the methodology , we focus on the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and its spatial patterns . We find nonsymmetric temperature patterns corresponding to El Nino and La Nina , and we compare the results of MCF with other techniques , such as the symmetric solutions of PCA , and the nonsymmetric solutions of Nonlinear PCA ( NLPCA ) . We found that MCF solutions are more reliable than the NLPCA fits , and can capture mixtures of principal components . Finally , we apply Extreme Value Theory on the temporal variations extracted from our methodology . We find that the tails of the distribution of extreme temperatures during La Nina episodes is bounded , while the tail during El Ninos is less likely to be bounded . This implies that the mean spatial patterns of the two phases are asymmetric , as well as the behaviour of their extremes .

In a burning plasma machine design like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) , dust contamination presents problems for diagnostic integration and may contribute to tritium safety issues . Additionally due to ITER design , such dust contamination problems are projected to become of even greater concern due to dust/wall interactions and possible instabilities created within the plasma by such particulates . Since the dynamics of such dust can in general be explained employing a combination of the ion drag , Coulomb force , and ion pre-sheath drifts , recent research in complex ( dusty ) plasma physics often offers unique insights for this research area . This paper will discuss the possibility of how experimental observations of the dust and plasma parameters within a GEC rf Reference Cell might be employed to diagnose conditions within fusion reactors , hopefully providing insight into possible mechanisms for dust detection and removal .

Our computed transition matrix element ( $ 1.34\times10^ { -4 } \mu_ { B } $ ) is in excellent agreement with the experimental value ( $ 1.33\times10^ { -4 } $ $ \mu_ { B } $ ) . This value in combination with other known quantities will be helpful to determine the parity non-conserving amplitude for the $ 6s^ { 2 } ^ { 1 } S_ { 0 } \longrightarrow6s5d ^ { 3 } D_ { 1 } $ transition in atomic Yb . To our knowledge our calculation is the most accurate to date and can be very important in the search of physics beyond the standard model . We further report the $ 6s6p ^ { 3 } P_ { 0 } \longrightarrow6s6p ^ { 1 } P_ { 1 } $ and $ 6s5d ^ { 3 } D_ { 1 } \longrightarrow6s6p ^ { 3 } P_ { 0 } $ transition matrix elements which are also in good agreement with the earlier theoretical estimates .

The present study demonstrates that CCSD ( T ) estimates the ionization potentials ( IPs ) and the valence electron removal energies quite accurately for alkali atoms and singly ionized alkaline earth ions , but yields unphysical energy levels for atoms and/or ions with partially filled sub-shell like C II . We further demonstrate that the higher body excitation effects can be incorporated more effectively through the unitary coupled cluster theory ( UCC ) compared to the CCSD ( T ) method .
0707.3586	physics.atom-ph physics.plasm-ph	Branching ratios of radiative transitions in O VI	We study the branching ratios of the allowed and forbidden radiative transitions among the first few ( 9 ) fine structure levels of O VI using relativistic coupled cluster theory . We find irregular patterns for a number of transitions with in $ n $ -complexes with $ n\le4 $ . We have used the exisiting values of the allowed electric dipole ( $ E1 $ ) transition as a benchmark of our theory . Good agreement with the existing values establish accuracies of not only the theoretical method but the basis function as well . In general the electric quadrupole ( $ E2 $ ) transition probabilities are greater in magnitude than magnetic dipole ( $ M1 $ ) transition probabilities , whereas for medium atomic transition frequencies they are of the same order of magnitude . On the other hand if the transitions involved are between two fine structure components of the same term , then the $ M1 $ transition probability is more probable than that of $ E2 $ . We have analyzed these trends with physical arguments and order of magnitude estimations . The results presented here in tabular and graphical forms are compared with the available theoretical and observed data . Graphical analysis helps to understand the trends of electric and magnetic transitions for the decay channels presented here . Our calculated values of the lifetimes of the excited states are in very good agreement with the available results .

Several attempts have been made to built more accurate clocks with different ion species . In this article we discuss the electric quadrupole and hyperfine shifts in the $ 5d^ { 9 } 6s^ { 2 } ^ { 2 } D_ { 5/2 } ( F=0 , m_ { F } =0 ) \leftrightarrow5d^ { 10 } 6s ^ { 2 } S_ { 1/2 } ( F=2 , m_ { F } =0 ) $ clock transition in $ ^ { 199 } Hg^ { + } $ , one of the most promising candidates for next generation optical clocks . We have applied Fock-space unitary coupled-cluster ( FSUCC ) theory to study the electric quadrupole moment of the $ 5d^ { 9 } 6s^ { 2 } ^ { 2 } D_ { 5/2 } $ state and magnetic dipole hyperfine constants of $ 5d^ { 9 } 6s^ { 2 } ^ { 2 } D_ { 3/2,5/2 } $ and $ 5d^ { 10 } 6s^ { 1 } ^ { 2 } S_ { 1/2 } $ states respectively of $ ^ { 199 } Hg^ { + } $ . We have also compared our results with available data .

0707.3641	physics.optics	Non-Magnetic Cloak without Reflection	In an electromagnetic cloak based on a transformation approach , reduced sets of material properties are generally favored due to their easier implementation in reality , although a seemingly inevitable drawback of undesired reflection exists in such cloaks . Here we suggest using high-order transformations to create smooth moduli at the outer boundary of the cloak , therefore completely eliminating the detrimental scattering within the limit of geometric optics . We apply this scheme to a non-magnetic cylindrical cloak and demonstrate that the scattered field is reduced substantially in a cloak with optimal quadratic transformation as compared to its linear counterpart .
