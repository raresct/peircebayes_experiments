We show how slow-light phenomena in dispersive structured media allow for a reduction in the required optical path length of an order of magnitude . The same ideas may be used to enhance the sensitivity of CD measurements while maintaining the same optical path length through the sample . Finally , the sensitivity may be enhanced in frequency regimes where CD data is typically not accessible due to a modest chiral response of the enantiomers .

Since there is a growing need for better understanding of this nonlinear process , it has led to the development of new and more advanced data analysis techniques . In this paper we present an analysis of the floating potential fluctuations which show the existence of a stochastic multifractal process along with low dimensional chaos . This has been shown primarily by wavelet analysis , and cross checked using other nonlinear techniques .

An example of this distribution is the charged particles that are distributed over fractal . The fractional integrals are used to describe fractal distribution . These integrals are considered as approximations of integrals on fractals . Typical turbulent media could be of a fractal structure and the corresponding equations should be changed to include the fractal features of the media . The magnetohydrodynamics equations for fractal media are derived from the fractional generalization of integral Maxwell equations and integral hydrodynamics ( balance ) equations . Possible equilibrium states for these equations are considered .

We predict a parity violating energy shift of their sublevels , linear in E , and the weak nuclear charge Q_W $ . A dressing beam of 10 kW/cm $ ^2 $ at 506 nm produces a shift of $ \sim100 \mu $ Hz at E=100 V/cm , B $ \gtrsim $ 30 mG . It should be observable with $ \sim 10^4 $ Fr atoms confined in an optical dipole trap . We discuss optimal conditions , parameter reversals and a calibration procedure to measure $ Q_W $ .

We determine the upper critical diameter for diffusion-dominated motion and the lower critical diameter for pure convection-induced displacement . Our model explains the systematic deviation , observed for small particles in several experiments , from the critical diameter for separation given by simple laminar flow considerations .
0711.0354	physics.flu-dyn	Investigations of the NS-alpha model using a lid-driven cavity flow	In this paper we investigate a subgrid model based on an anisotropic version of the NS- $ \alpha $ model using a lid-driven cavity flow at a Reynolds number of 10,000 . Previously the NS- $ \alpha $ model has only been used numerically in the isotropic form . The subgrid model is developed from the Eulerian-averaged anisotropic equations [ Holm , \textit { Physica D } , v.133 , pp 215-269 , 1999 ] . It was found that when $ \alpha^ { 2 } $ was based on the mesh numerical oscillations developed which manifested themselves in the appearance of streamwise vortices and a `mixing out ' of the velocity profile . This is analogous to the Craik-Leibovich mechanism , with the difference being that the oscillations here are not physical but numerical . The problem could be traced back to the discontinuity in $ \alpha^ { 2 } $ encountered when $ \alpha^ { 2 } =0 $ on the endwalls . An alternative definition of $ \alpha^ { 2 } $ based on velocity gradients , rather than mesh spacing , is proposed and tested . Using this definition the results with the model shown a significant improvement . The splitting of the downstream wall jet , rms and shear stress profiles are correctly captured a coarse mesh . The model is shown to predict both positive and negative energy transfer in the jet impingement region , in qualitative agreement with DNS results .

To achieve the long observation times necessary for direct time-domain measurement , vibrationally excited NH ( X triplet-Sigma- , v=1 , N=0 ) radicals are magnetically trapped using helium buffer-gas loading . Simultaneous trapping and lifetime measurement of both the NH ( v=1 , N=0 ) and NH ( v=0 , N=0 ) populations allows for accurate extraction of tau_rad , exp . Background helium atoms are present during our measurement of tau_rad , exp. , and the rate constant for helium atom induced collisional quenching of NH ( v=1 , N=0 ) was determined to be k_q < 3.9 * 10^-15 cm^3/s . This bound on k_q yields the quoted systematic uncertainty on tau_rad , exp . Using an ab initio dipole moment function and an RKR potential , we also determine a theoretical value of 36.99 ms for this lifetime , in agreement with our experimental value . Our results provide an independent determination of tau_rad,10 , test molecular theory , and furthermore demonstrate the efficacy of buffer-gas loading and trapping in determining metastable radiative and collisional lifetimes .

The goal of our analysis is to establish critical components of the theory required to describe polar solvation at the mesoscopic scale . The analytical techniques include a microscopic formalism based on structure factors of the solvent dipolar orientations and density and continuum dielectric theories . The microscopic theory employs the atomistic structure of the protein with force-field atomic charges and solvent structure factors obtained from separate MD simulations of the homogeneous solvent . The MD simulations provide linear response solvation free energies and reorganization energies of electron transfer in the temperature range 280 -- 310 K. We found that continuum models universally underestimate solvation entropies , and a more favorable agreement is reported between the microscopic calculations and MD simulations . The analysis of simulations also suggests that difficulties of extending standard formalisms to protein solvation are related to the inhomogeneous structure of the solvation shell at the protein-water interface combining islands of highly structured water around ionized residues along with partial dewetting of hydrophobic patches . Quantitative theories of electrostatic protein hydration need to incorporate realistic density profile of water at the protein-water interface .
