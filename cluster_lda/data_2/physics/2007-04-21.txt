0704.2822	physics.atom-ph	QED calculation of the 2p1/2-2s and 2p3/2-2s transition energies and the ground-state hyperfine splitting in lithiumlike scandium	We present the most accurate up-to-date theoretical values of the { 2p_ { 1/2 } } - { 2s } and { 2p_ { 3/2 } } - { 2s } transition energies and the ground-state hyperfine splitting in $ { \rm Sc } ^ { 18+ } $ . All two- and three-electron contributions to the energy values up to the two-photon level are treated in the framework of bound-state QED without $ \aZ $ -expansion . The interelectronic interaction beyond the two-photon level is taken into account by means of the large-scale configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm ( CI-DFS ) method . The relativistic recoil correction is calculated with many-electron wave functions in order to take into account the electron-correlation effect . The accuracy of the transition energy values is improved by a factor of five compared to the previous calculations . The CI-DFS calculation of interelectronic-interaction effects and the evaluation of the QED correction in an effective screening potential provide significant improvement for the $ 2s $ hyperfine splitting . The results obtained are in a good agreement with recently published experimental data .
0704.2831	physics.plasm-ph	White-light parametric instabilities in plasmas	Parametric instabilities driven by partially coherent radiation in plasmas are described by a generalized statistical Wigner-Moyal set of equations , formally equivalent to the full wave equation , coupled to the plasma fluid equations . A generalized dispersion relation for Stimulated Raman Scattering driven by a partially coherent pump field is derived , revealing a growth rate dependence , with the coherence width $ \sigma $ of the radiation field , scaling with $ 1/\sigma $ for backscattering ( three-wave process ) , and with $ 1/\sigma^ { 1/2 } $ for direct forward scattering ( four-wave process ) . Our results demonstrate the possibility to control the growth rates of these instabilities by properly using broadband pump radiation fields .
0704.2832	physics.flu-dyn	Endogenous and exogenous dynamics of pressure fluctuations in an impinging entrained-flow gasifier	This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to a fatal error in the analysis . The manuscript was submitted to Chemical Engineering Science . To clarify the situation , we copy the main comment from an anonymous referee here : '' To my understanding , the authors analyze i = 1 ... 63 time series and calculate their mean and standard deviation . These time series correspond to individual , single ignition processes . Is this correct ? If yes , these processes , as Fig . 3 shows very clearly , are not stationary , and the pressure difference ( i.e. , the signal ) quickly decays to zero . In this case both the mean and the standard deviation are poorly defined , for example because both depend in a trivial fashion on the observation period T. I am not aware of any study ( including those cited by the authors ) which allows for any conclusion from such non-stationary signals . The results of Menezes and Barabasi are strictly only valid for stationary time series , and they can not be applied at all in this case . '' We agree with this insightful comment that our data are not stationary and the method adopted in our manuscript does not apply . We do not see any possibility to correct this error and decide to withdraw it . We would like to thank gratefully the referee and apologize for any inconvenience caused by our oversight .
