0704.2883	physics.soc-ph	A physicist 's view of the notion of `` racism ''	It is not uncommon , e.g . in the media , that specific groups are categorized as being racist . Based on an extensive dataset of intermarriage statistics our study questions the legitimacy of such characterizations . It suggests that , far from being group-dependent , segregation mechanisms are instead situation-dependent . More precisely , the degree of integration of a minority in terms of the frequency of intermarriage is seen to crucially depend upon the the proportion p of the minority . Thus , a population may have a segregative behavior with respect to a high-p ( p > 20 % ) minority A and at the same time a tolerant attitude toward a low-p ( p < 2 % ) minority B . This remains true even when A and B represent the same minority ; for instance Black-White intermarriage is much more frequent in Montana than it is in South Carolina . In short , the nature of minority groups is largely irrelevant , the key factor being their proportion in a given area .

The bistability curves show crossings that indicate a competition between a Kerr-like effect induced by the polariton population and thermal effects . Associated with the bistability , laser-like emission occurs at the bare cavity mode .
