Energy transfer , mediated by surface plasmons , from donor molecules to acceptor molecules over ten micrometer distances is demonstrated . Also surface plasmon coupled emission from the donor molecules is observed at similar distances away from the excitation spot . The lithographic fabrication method we use for positioning the dye molecules allows scaling to nanometer dimensions . The use of molecules as couplers between far-field and near-field light offers the advantages that no special excitation geometry is needed , any light source can be used to excite plasmons and the excitation can be localized below the diffraction limit . Moreover , the use of molecules has the potential for integration with molecular electronics and for the use of molecular self-assembly in fabrication . Our results constitute a proof-of-principle demonstration of a plasmonic waveguide where signal in- and outcoupling is done by molecules .

The time needed for the conquering language to become dominating is about 2/s for directed Barabasi-Albert networks , but diverges on the square lattice for decreasing s at some critical value sc
