The long-range molecular interaction coefficients are calculated for the molecular symmetries $ \Delta $ , $ \Pi $ , and $ \Sigma $ , arising from the following interactions : He ( $ 2 ^1P $ ) -- He ( $ 2 ^1P $ ) , He ( $ 2 ^1P $ ) -- He ( $ 2 ^3P $ ) , and He ( $ 2 ^3P $ ) -- He ( $ 2 ^3P $ ) . The electric quadrupole-quadrupole term , $ C_ { 5 } $ , the van der Waals ( dispersion ) term $ C_ { 6 } $ , and higher-order terms , $ C_ { 8 } $ , and $ C_ { 10 } $ , are calculated \textit { ab initio } using accurate variational wave functions in Hylleraas coordinates with finite nuclear mass effects . A comparison is made with previously published results where available .

0705.1654	physics.flu-dyn	Momentum Transfer to Nanoobjects between Parallel Heated Plates	A small-scale , trapezoidal rigid body in the gas-filled gap between two parallel plates at different temperatures is considered . An analytical expression for the force onto the body in the direction parallel to the plates valid for an infinite Knudsen number is derived . Simultaneously , Monte-Carlo simulations are performed allowing to extend the analysis to Knudsen numbers of the order of one . The numerical and the analytical results show excellent agreement , indicating that a temperature gradient orthogonal to the plates can induce a significant force in parallel direction . This force is only slightly reduced when a Knudsen number of one is considered . In the future , the discovered effect may be exploited for the conversion of thermal into mechanical energy in nanomachines .

The device is based on Coherent Population Trapping ( CPT ) produced by a multi-frequency excitation . CPT resonance is observed when a frequency comb , generated by diode laser current modulation , excites Cs atoms confined in a $ \pi/4\times ( 2.5 ) ^2\times1 \textrm { cm } ^3 $ , 2 Torr $ N_2 $ buffered cell . A fully optical sensor is connected through an optical fiber to the laser head allowing for truly remote sensing and minimization of the field perturbation . A detailed analysis of the CPT resonance parameters as a function of the optical detuning has been made in order to get high sensitivity measurements . The magnetic field monitoring performances and the best sensitivity obtained in a balanced differential configuration of the sensor are presented .
0705.1679	physics.soc-ph	Extracting the hierarchical organization of complex systems	Extracting understanding from the growing `` sea '' of biological and socio-economic data is one of the most pressing scientific challenges facing us . Here , we introduce and validate an unsupervised method that is able to accurately extract the hierarchical organization of complex biological , social , and technological networks . We define an ensemble of hierarchically nested random graphs , which we use to validate the method . We then apply our method to real-world networks , including the air-transportation network , an electronic circuit , an email exchange network , and metabolic networks . We find that our method enables us to obtain an accurate multi-scale descriptions of a complex system .

0705.1717	physics.chem-ph	Relation between exchange-only optimized potential and Kohn-Sham methods with finite basis sets ; solution of a paradox	Arguments showing that exchange-only optimized effective potential ( xOEP ) methods , with finite basis sets , can not in general yield the Hartree-Fock ( HF ) ground state energy , but a higher one , are given . While the orbital products of a complete basis are linearly dependent , the HF ground state energy can only be obtained via a basis set xOEP scheme in the special case that all products of occupied and unoccupied orbitals emerging from the employed orbital basis set are linearly independent from each other . In this case , however , exchange potentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysical oscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham ( KS ) exchange potential . These findings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov , Scuseria and Davidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF ground state energy despite the fact that within a real space ( or complete basis ) representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HF energy . Moreover , whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital products are linearly independent , it is shown that basis set xOEP methods only represent exact exchange-only ( EXX ) KS methods , i.e. , proper density-functional methods , if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing the exchange potential are balanced to each other , i.e. , if the orbital basis is comprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis . Otherwise xOEP methods do not represent EXX KS methods and yield unphysical exchange potentials .

Items and concepts are represented by vectors in Fock space and membership weights of items are modeled by quantum probabilities . We apply this theory to model the disjunction of concepts and show that the predictions of our theory for the membership weights of items regarding the disjunction of concepts match with great accuracy the complete set of results of an experiment conducted by Hampton ( 1988b ) . It are the quantum effects of interference and superposition of that are at the origin of the effects of overextension and underextension observed by Hampton as deviations from a classical use of the disjunction . It is essential for the perfect matches we obtain between the predictions of the quantum field model and Hampton 's experimental data that items can be in superpositions of `different numbers states ' which proves that the genuine structure of quantum field theory is needed to match predictions with experimental data .
