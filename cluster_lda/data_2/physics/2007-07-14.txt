0707.2178	physics.optics	Stimulated radiative laser cooling	Building a refrigerator based on the conversion of heat into optical energy is an ongoing engineering challenge . Under well-defined conditions , spontaneous anti-Stokes fluorescence of a dopant material in a host matrix is capable of lowering the host temperature . The fluorescence is conveying away a part of the thermal energy stored in the vibrational oscillations of the host lattice . In particular , applying this principle to the cooling of ( solid-state ) lasers opens up many potential device applications , especially in the domain of high-power lasers . In this paper , an alternative optical cooling scheme is outlined , leading to radiative cooling of solid-state lasers . It is based on converting the thermal energy stored in the host , into optical energy by means of a stimulated nonlinear process , rather than a spontaneous process . This should lead to better cooling efficiencies and a higher potential of applying the principle for device applications .
