The generic `` canonical '' form of the posterior distribution for the problem of simultaneous updating with data and moments is obtained . We discuss the general problem of non-commuting constraints , when they should be processed sequentially and when simultaneously . As an illustration , the multinomial example of die tosses is solved in detail for two superficially similar but actually very different problems .
0708.1643	physics.gen-ph	Local Lorentz Transformation and `` Lorentz Violation ''	Some solutions to the anomalies of ultra high energy cosmic-ray ( UHECR ) and TeV $ \gamma $ -rays require disturbed non-quadratic dispersion relations , which suggest the Lorentz violation . Also , some new theories such as quantum gravity , string theory and the standard model extension imply the Lorentz violation . In this paper , we derive some transformation laws for the classical parameters of nonlinear field system , and then provide their dispersion relations . These dispersion relations also have non-quadratic form but keep the Lorentz invariance . The analysis of this paper may be helpful for understanding the quantum theory and the plausible Lorentz violation .
0708.1644	physics.flu-dyn	Ricci curvature and geodesic flows stability in Riemannian twisted flux tubes	Ricci and sectional curvatures of twisted flux tubes in Riemannian manifold are computed to investigate the stability of the tubes . The geodesic equations are used to show that in the case of thick tubes , the curvature of planar ( Frenet torsion-free ) tubes have the effect ct of damping the flow speed along the tube . Stability of geodesic flows in the Riemannian twisted thin tubes ( almost filaments ) , against constant radial perturbations is investigated by using the method of negative sectional curvature for unstable flows . No special form of the flow like Beltrami flows is admitted , and the proof is general for the case of thin tubes . It is found that for positive perturbations and angular speed of the flow , instability is achieved , since the sectional Ricci curvature of the twisted tube metric is negative .

Here we report results of experiments of molecular hydrogen formation on amorphous silicate surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption ( TPD ) . In these experiments beams of H and D atoms are irradiated on the surface of an amorphous silicate sample . The desorption rate of HD molecules is monitored using a mass spectrometer during a subsequent TPD run . The results are analyzed using rate equations and the activation energies of the processes leading to molecular hydrogen formation are obtained from the TPD data . We show that a model based on a single isotope provides the correct results for the activation energies for diffusion and desorption of H atoms . These results can thus be used to evaluate the formation rate of H_2 on dust grains under the actual conditions present in interstellar clouds .

Always we stress the very different characteristics of the gaussian with respect to the Bessel waves and to the LWs , showing the numerous and important properties of the latter w.r.t . the former ones : Properties that may find application in all fields in which an essential role is played by a wave-equation ( like electromagnetism , optics , acoustics , seismology , geophysics , gravitation , elementary particle physics , etc . ) . In the second part of this paper ( namely , in its Appendix ) , we recall at first how , in the seventies and eighties , the geometrical methods of Special Relativity ( SR ) had predicted -- in the sense below specified -- the existence of the most interesting LWs , i.e. , of the X-shaped pulses . At last , in connection with the circumstance that the X-shaped waves are endowed with Superluminal group-velocities ( as carefully discussed in the first part of this article ) , we briefly mention the various experimental sectors of physics in which Superluminal motions seem to appear : In particular , a bird's-eye view is presented of the experiments till now performed with evanescent waves ( and/or tunneling photons ) , and with the `` localized Superluminal solutions '' to the wave equations .
0708.1662	physics.atom-ph	Transition frequency shifts with fine structure constant variation for Fe II : Breit and core-valence correlation correction	Transition frequencies of Fe II ion are known to be very sensitive to variation of the fine structure constant \alpha . The resonance absorption lines of Fe II from objects at cosmological distances are used in a search for the possible variation of \alpha in cause of cosmic time . In this paper we calculated the dependence of the transition frequencies on \alpha^2 ( q-factors ) for Fe II ion . We found corrections to these coefficients from valence-valence and core-valence correlations and from the Breit interaction . Both the core-valence correlation and Breit corrections to the q-factors appeared to be larger than had been anticipated previously . Nevertheless our calculation confirms that the Fe II absorption lines seen in quasar spectra have large q-factors of both signs and thus the ion Fe II alone can be used in the search for the \alpha-variation at different cosmological epochs .
0708.1691	physics.med-ph	PET monitoring of cancer therapy with He-3 and C-12 beams : a study with the GEANT4 toolkit	We study the spatial distributions of $ \beta^+ $ -activity produced by therapeutic beams of $ ^3 $ He and $ ^ { 12 } $ C ions in various tissue-like materials . The calculations were performed within a Monte Carlo model for Heavy-Ion Therapy ( MCHIT ) based on the GEANT4 toolkit . The contributions from $ ^ { 10,11 } $ C , $ ^ { 13 } $ N , $ ^ { 14,15 } $ O , $ ^ { 17,18 } $ F and $ ^ { 30 } $ P positron-emitting nuclei were calculated and compared with experimental data obtained during and after irradiation . Positron emitting nuclei are created by $ ^ { 12 } $ C beam in fragmentation reactions of projectile and target nuclei . This leads to a $ \beta^+ $ -activity profile characterised by a noticeable peak located close to the Bragg peak in the corresponding depth-dose distribution . On the contrary , as the most of positron-emitting nuclei are produced by $ ^3 $ He beam in target fragmentation reactions , the calculated total $ \beta^+ $ -activity during or soon after the irradiation period is evenly distributed within the projectile range . However , we predict also the presence of $ ^ { 13 } $ N , $ ^ { 14 } $ O , $ ^ { 17,18 } $ F created in charge-transfer reactions by low-energy $ ^3 $ He ions close to the end of their range in several tissue-like media . The time evolution of $ \beta^+ $ -activity profiles was investigated for both kinds of beams . Due to the production of $ ^ { 18 } $ F nuclide the $ \beta^+ $ -activity profile measured 2 or 3 hours after irradiation with $ ^ { 3 } $ He ions will have a distinct peak correlated with the maximum of depth-dose distribution . We found certain advantages of low-energy $ ^ { 3 } $ He beams over low-energy proton beams for reliable PET monitoring during particle therapy of shallow located tumours . In this case the distal edge of $ \beta^+ $ -activity distribution from $ ^ { 17 } $ F nuclei clearly marks the range of $ ^ { 3 } $ He in tissues .

If the system in equilibrium is subject to the conservation constraint of some extensive property ( e.g . volume , material , or energy conservation ) , the Euler equation determining the stationary point corresponding to the equilibrium alters according to the method of Lagrange multipliers . Here , the question as to how the effects of constraints can be taken into account in a stability analysis based on second functional derivatives is examined . It is shown that the concept of constrained second derivatives incorporates all the effects due to constraints ; therefore constrained second derivatives provide the proper tool for the stability analysis of equilibria under constraints . For a physically important type of constraints , it is demonstrated how the presented theory works . Further , the rigorous derivation of a recently obtained stability condition for a special case of equilibrium of ultrathin-film binary mixtures is given , presenting a guide for similar analyses .

0708.1722	physics.plasm-ph physics.flu-dyn	Saffman-Taylor streamers : mutual finger interaction in an electric breakdown	Bunches of streamers form the early stages of sparks and lightning but theory presently concentrates on single streamers or on coarse approximations of whole breakdown trees . Here a periodic array of interacting streamer discharges in a strong homogeneous electric field is studied in PDE approximation in two dimensions . If the period of the streamer array is small enough , the streamers do not branch , but approach uniform translation . When the streamers are close to the branching regime , the enhanced field at the tip of the streamer is close to $ 2 E_ { \infty } $ , where $ E_ { \infty } $ is the homogeneous field applied between the electrodes . We discuss a moving boundary approximation to the set of PDEs . This moving boundary model turns out to be essentially the same as the one for two-fluid Hele-Shaw flows . In two dimensions , this model possesses a known analytical solution . The shape of the 2D interacting streamers in uniform motion obtained from the PDE simulations is actually well fitted by the analytically known `` selected Saffman-Taylor finger '' . This finding helps to understand streamer interactions and raises new questions on the general theory of finger selection in moving boundary problems .
0708.1743	physics.atom-ph	Production of long-lived atomic vapor inside high-density buffer gas	Atomic vapor of four different paramagnetic species : gold , silver , lithium , and rubidium , is produced and studied inside several buffer gases : helium , nitrogen , neon , and argon . The paramagnetic atoms are injected into the buffer gas using laser ablation . Wires with diameters 25 $ \mu $ m , 50 $ \mu $ m , and 100 $ \mu $ m are used as ablation targets for gold and silver , bulk targets are used for lithium and rubidium . The buffer gas cools and confines the ablated atoms , slowing down their transport to the cell walls . Buffer gas temperatures between 20 K and 295 K , and densities between $ 10^ { 16 } $ cm $ ^ { -3 } $ and $ 2\times10^ { 19 } $ cm $ ^ { -3 } $ are explored . Peak paramagnetic atom densities of $ 10^ { 11 } $ cm $ ^ { -3 } $ are routinely achieved . The longest observed paramagnetic vapor density decay times are 110 ms for silver at 20 K and 4 ms for lithium at 32 K. The candidates for the principal paramagnetic-atom loss mechanism are impurities in the buffer gas , dimer formation and atom loss on sputtered clusters .

We account for this observation by generating random variables that determ ine the social diversity of players engaging in the prisoner 's dilemma game . Here the term social diversity is used to address extrinsic factors that determine the mapping of game pay offs to individual fitness . These factors may increase or decrease the fitness of a player depending on its location on the spatial grid . We consider different distributions of extrin sic factors that determine the social diversity of players , and find that the power-law distribution enables the best promotion of cooperation . The facilitation of the cooperative str ategy relies mostly on the inhomogeneous social state of players , resulting in the formation of cooperative clusters which are ruled by socially high-ranking players that are able to prevail against the defectors even when there is a large temptation to defect . To confirm this , we also study the impact of spatially correlated social diversity and find that coopera tion deteriorates as the spatial correlation length increases . Our results suggest that the distribution of wealth and social status might have played a crucial role by the evolution of cooperation amongst egoistic individuals .
0708.1750	physics.atom-ph	Dark-State Polaritons in Single- and Double- $ \Lambda $ Media	We derive the properties of polaritons in single- $ \Lambda $ and double- $ \Lambda $ media using a microscopic equation-of-motion technique . In each case , the polaritonic dispersion relation and composition arise from a matrix eigenvalue problem for arbitrary control field strengths . We show that the double- $ \Lambda $ medium can be used to up- or down-convert single photons while preserving quantum coherence . The existence of a dark-state polariton protects this single-photon four-wave mixing effect against incoherent decay of the excited atomic states . The efficiency of this conversion is limited mainly by the sample size and the lifetime of the metastable state .
0708.1754	physics.chem-ph physics.optics	Treatment of Linear and Nonlinear Dielectric Property of Molecular Monolayer and Submonolayer with Microscopic Dipole Lattice Model : I . Second Harmonic Generation and Sum-Frequency Generation	In the currently accepted models of the nonlinear optics , the nonlinear radiation was treated as the result of an infinitesimally thin polarization sheet layer , and a three layer model was generally employed . The direct consequence of this approach is that an apriori dielectric constant , which still does not have a clear definition , has to be assigned to this polarization layer . Because the Second Harmonic Generation ( SHG ) and the Sum-Frequency Generation vibrational Spectroscopy ( SFG-VS ) have been proven as the sensitive probes for interfaces with the submonolayer coverage , the treatment based on the more realistic discrete induced dipole model needs to be developed . Here we show that following the molecular optics theory approach the SHG , as well as the SFG-VS , radiation from the monolayer or submonolayer at an interface can be rigorously treated as the radiation from an induced dipole lattice at the interface . In this approach , the introduction of the polarization sheet is no longer necessary . Therefore , the ambiguity of the unaccounted dielectric constant of the polarization layer is no longer an issue . Moreover , the anisotropic two dimensional microscopic local field factors can be explicitly expressed with the linear polarizability tensors of the interfacial molecules . Based on the planewise dipole sum rule in the molecular monolayer , crucial experimental tests of this microscopic treatment with SHG and SFG-VS are discussed . Many puzzles in the literature of surface SHG and SFG spectroscopy studies can also be understood or resolved in this framework . This new treatment may provide a solid basis for the quantitative analysis in the surface SHG and SFG studies .
0708.1759	physics.ed-ph	Blogging in the physics classroom : A research-based approach to shaping students ' attitudes towards physics	Even though there has been a tremendous amount of research done in how to help students learn physics , students are still coming away missing a crucial piece of the puzzle : why bother with physics ? Students learn fundamental laws and how to calculate , but come out of a general physics course without a deep understanding of how physics has transformed the world around them . In other words , they get the `` how '' but not the `` why '' . Studies have shown that students leave introductory physics courses almost universally with decreased expectations and with a more negative attitude . This paper will detail an experiment to address this problem : a course weblog or `` blog '' which discusses real-world applications of physics and engages students in discussion and thinking outside of class . Specifically , students ' attitudes towards the value of physics and its applicability to the real-world were probed using a 26-question Likert scale survey over the course of four semesters in an introductory physics course at a comprehensive Jesuit university . We found that students who did not participate in the blog study generally exhibited a deterioration in attitude towards physics as seen previously . However , students who read , commented , and were involved with the blog maintained their initially positive attitudes towards physics . Student response to the blog was overwhelmingly positive , with students claiming that the blog made the things we studied in the classroom come alive for them and seem much more relevant .
0708.1777	physics.chem-ph physics.comp-ph	Electronic Ground State of Higher Acenes	We examine the electronic ground state of acenes with different number of fused benzene rings ( up to 40 ) by using first principles density functional theory . Their properties are compared with those of infinite polyacene . We find that the ground state of acenes that consist of more than seven fused benzene rings is an antiferromagnetic ( in other words , open-shell singlet ) state , and we show that this singlet is not necessarily a diradical , because the spatially separated magnetizations for the spin-up and spin-down electrons increase with the size of the acene . For example , our results indicate that there are about four spin-up electrons localized at one zigzag edge of 20-acene . The reason that both acenes and polyacene have the antiferromagnetic ground state is due to the zigzag-shaped boundaries , which cause pi-electrons to localize and form spin orders at the edges . Both wider graphene ribbons and large rectangular-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been shown to share this antiferromagnetic ground state . Therefore , we demonstrate that the pi-electronic structure of higher acenes and ployacene are still dictated by the zigzag edges , and our results provide a consistent description of their electronic ground state .
0708.1791	physics.bio-ph	Load fluctuations drive actin network growth	The growth of actin filament networks is a fundamental biological process that drives a variety of cellular and intracellular motions . During motility , eukaryotic cells and intracellular pathogens are propelled by actin networks organized by nucleation-promoting factors , which trigger the formation of nascent filaments off the side of existing filaments in the network . A Brownian ratchet ( BR ) mechanism has been proposed to couple actin polymerization to cellular movements , whereby thermal motions are rectified by the addition of actin monomers at the end of growing filaments . Here , by following actin -- propelled microspheres using three -- dimensional laser tracking , we find that beads adhered to the growing network move via an object -- fluctuating BR . Velocity varies with the amplitude of thermal fluctuation and inversely with viscosity as predicted for a BR . In addition , motion is saltatory with a broad distribution of step sizes that is correlated in time . These data point to a model in which thermal fluctuations of the microsphere or entire actin network , and not individual filaments , govern motility . This conclusion is supported by Monte Carlo simulations of an adhesion -- based BR and suggests an important role for membrane tension in the control of actin -- based cellular protrusions .
