We analyze the effects and give a unified theoretical account of the experimental observations

The later are often taken as the first quantitative characteristics of complex systems , allowing one to detect the possible occurrence of regularities providing a step toward defining a classification of the different levels of organization ( the `` universality classes '' ) . A rapid survey covers the Gaussian law , the power law and the stretched exponential distributions . The fascination for power laws is then explained , starting from the statistical physics approach to critical phenomena , out-of-equilibrium phase transitions , self-organized criticality , and ending with a large but not exhaustive list of mechanisms leading to power law distributions . A check-list for testing and qualifying a power law distribution from your data is described in 7 steps . This essay enlarges the description of distributions by proposing that `` kings '' , i.e. , events even beyond the extrapolation of the power law tail , may reveal an information which is complementary and perhaps sometimes even more important than the power law distribution . We conclude a list of future directions .

We also study the effect of varying the coupling constant of the atom-atom interaction on the scattering length .

We also report the frequency measurement of 17 other lines with an accuracy of 2 kHz . Those lines are in quasi coincidence with the 9R ( 36 ) to 9R ( 42 ) CO $ _2 $ laser emission lines and are probed either by a CO $ _2 $ or a widely tunable quantum cascade laser phase locked to a master CO $ _2 $ laser . The relative stability of two HCOOH stabilized lasers is characterized by a relative Allan deviation of 4.5 10 $ ^ { -12 } $ $ \tau^ { -1/2 } $ . They give suitable frequency references for H $ _2^+ $ Doppler free two-photon spectroscopy .

The calculated hyperfine splitting are well in agreement with recent experimental results . We have also carried out the lifetimes of the 5p2P1=2 and 5p2P3=2 states , which are in well agreement with recent experimental result ( Moehring et al. , PRA 73 023413 , 2006 ) . The roles of different electron correlation effects in the determination of these quantities are discussed and their contributions are presented in the CC terms .
0707.2232	physics.atom-ph	Backward scattering of low-energy antiprotons by highly charged and neutral uranium : Coulomb glory	Collisions of antiprotons with He- , Ne- , Ni-like , bare , and neutral uranium are studied theoretically for scattering angles close to 180 $ ^ { \circ } $ and antiproton energies with the interval 100 eV -- 10 keV . We investigate the Coulomb glory effect which is caused by a screening of the Coulomb potential of the nucleus and results in a prominent maximum of the differential cross section in the backward direction at some energies of the incident particle . We found that for larger numbers of electrons in the ion the effect becomes more pronounced and shifts to higher energies of the antiproton . On the other hand , a maximum of the differential cross section in the backward direction can also be found in the scattering of antiprotons on a bare uranium nucleus . The latter case can be regarded as a manifestation of the screening property of the vacuum-polarization potential in non-relativistic collisions of heavy particles .
