The amplification of such uncertainties through upward or downward transitions by a homogenisation model is emphasized and exemplified with the Mori-Tanaka model . In particular , the sensitivity to data uncertainty in the inverse determination of constituent parameters based on downward transitions is stressed on an example . Then a database improvement method , which exploits simultaneously the available information on constitutive uncertainties at all scales instead of just propagating those associated with one scale , is presented and shown to yield substantial reductions in uncertainty for both the constitutive parameters and the response of structures . The latter finding is demonstrated on two examples of structures , with significant gains in confidence obtained on both .
