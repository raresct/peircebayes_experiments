This technique has been used to measure forces in the range of pico- and femto-Newton , assessing the mechanical properties of biomolecules as well as of other microscopic systems . For a correct use of the PFM , the force field to measure has to be invariable ( homogeneous ) on the scale of the Brownian motion of the trapped probe . This condition implicates that the force field must be conservative , excluding the possibility of a rotational component . However , there are cases where these assumptions are not fulfilled Here , we show how to improve the PFM technique in order to be able to deal with these cases . We introduce the theory of this enhanced PFM and we propose a concrete analysis workflow to reconstruct the force field from the experimental time-series of the probe position . Furthermore , we experimentally verify some particularly important cases , namely the case of a conservative or rotational force-field .

During this time period , data were taken at different points in the gravitational potential of the Sun . The data are fitted to the variation in the gravitational potential yielding a value of $ ( -8.7 \pm 6.6 ) \times 10^ { -6 } $ for the fit parameter $ k_\alpha $ . This value gives the current best laboratory limit . In addition , our value of $ k_ { \alpha } $ combined with other experimental constraints is used to extract the first limits on k_e and k_q . These coefficients characterize the variation of m_e/m_p and m_q/m_p in a changing gravitational potential , where m_e , m_p , and m_q are electron , proton , and quark masses . The results are $ k_e = ( 4.9 \pm 3.9 ) \times 10^ { -5 } $ and $ k_q = ( 6.6 \pm 5.2 ) \times 10^ { -5 } $ .

A 64 , 062503 ( 2001 ) ] , a simple derivation of the density-functional correction of the Hartree-Fock equations , the Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham equations , is presented , completing an integrated view of quantum mechanical theories , in which the Kohn-Sham equations , the Hartree-Fock-Kohn-Sham equations and the ground-state Schrodinger equation formally stem from a common ground : density-functional theory , through its Euler equation for the ground-state density . Along similar lines , the Kohn-Sham formulation of the Hartree-Fock approach is also considered . Further , it is pointed out that the exchange energy of density-functional theory built from the Kohn-Sham orbitals can be given by degree-two homogeneous N-particle density functionals ( N=1,2 , ... ) , forming a sequence of degree-two homogeneous exchange-energy density functionals , the first element of which is minus the classical Coulomb-repulsion energy functional .
