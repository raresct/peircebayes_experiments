The effect of radiation damage on the chip operating in a particle detector at high frequency at a future accelerator is studied , specifically the creation of two electron trap levels , 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV below the bottom of the conduction band . Good agreement is found between simulations using the ISE-TCAD DESSIS program and an analytical model for the former level but not for the latter . Optimum operation is predicted to be at about 250 K where the effects of the traps is minimal ; this being approximately independent of readout frequency in the range 7-50 MHz . The work has been carried out within the Linear Collider Flavour Identification ( LCFI ) collaboration in the context of the International Linear Collider ( ILC ) project .

In this paper , by making use of the $ \phi $ -mapping topological current theory , we investigate the topology in the closed and knotted optical vortices . The topological inner structure of the optical vortices are obtained , and the linking of the knotted optical vortices is also given .

By using the $ \phi $ -mapping topological current theory proposed by Prof. Duan , we rewrite the topological current form of RS vortices and use this topological current we reveal that the Hopf invariant of RS vortices is just the sum of the linking and self-linking numbers of the knotted RS vortices . Furthermore , the conservation of the Hopf invariant in the splitting , the mergence and the intersection processes of knotted RS vortices is also discussed .

Illustrative numerical results for an electron in two dimensions , subject to a confining potential V ( x , y ) , in a constant perpendicular magnetic field demonstrate the accuracy of the method .

Therefore , the CF effect depends on the sum of products of the two factors representing the identical multipole components of two different charge distributions . The term A_ { k } expresses the asphericity of the central ion open-shell , whereas the term S_ { k } the asphericity of its surroundings . When these two distributions do not fit each other the observed CF splitting can be unexpectedly weak even for considerable values of the total S= ( \sum_ { k } S_ { k } ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 1/2 } and A= ( \sum_ { k } A_ { k } ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 1/2 } . The tabulated quantities of the A_ { k } ( |\alpha SLJ > ) , as the 2^ { k } -pole type asphericities , are the intrinsic characteristics of the electron states revealing their multipolar structure and hence their potential susceptibility to CF splitting separately for each effective multipole .
0712.4243	physics.optics physics.gen-ph	Momentum transfer in a standing optical vortex	A field superposition of singular beams incident on , and then reflected from a mirror has been investigated . It was demonstrated that the standing optical wave , which contains a vortex , possesses an orbital angle momentum where the energy flux circulates only in the azimuth direction of the beam . We show in this paper that the standing light wave containing the optical vortex transfers angular momentum to a substance located in the field of the vortex without moving the substance in the azimuth or radial directions . This property of the standing vortex present an opportunity to form the three-dimensional optical traps , gasdynamic and hydrodynamic vortices , in a localised volume by a direct transfer of the orbital angular momentum from the optical vortex .

It is obtained as a result of random experiment with random events that have weights . In this paper the bin contents of weighted histogram are considered as a sum of random variables with random number of terms . Goodness of fit tests for weighted histograms and for weighted histograms with unknown normalization are proposed . Sizes and powers of the tests are investigated numerically .

In the mean field approximation , this model exhibits a critical coherence threshold , i.e . a minimal accuracy in the learning process is required to maintain linguistic coherence . In this work , we analyse in detail the effects of different fitness based dynamics driving linguistic coherence and of the network of interactions on the nature of the coherence threshold , by performing numerical simulations and theoretical analyses of generalized replicator-mutator dynamics in populations with two types of structure : fully connected networks and regular random graphs . We find that although the threshold of the replicator-mutator evolutionary model is robust with respect to the structure of the network of contacts , the coherence threshold of related fitness driven models may be strongly affected by this feature .

These observations raise questions regarding Galileo's assumptions about the universe and the conclusions he drew from his observations . Galileo would have expected Mizar to reveal annual parallax and thus provide evidence of Earth 's motion , but Mizar shows no such parallax .
0712.4288	physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech	Voter Models on Heterogeneous Networks	We study simple interacting particle systems on heterogeneous networks , including the voter model and the invasion process . These are both two-state models in which in an update event an individual changes state to agree with a neighbor . For the voter model , an individual `` imports '' its state from a randomly-chosen neighbor . Here the average time T_N to reach consensus for a network of N nodes with an uncorrelated degree distribution scales as N mu_1^2/mu_2 , where mu_k is the kth moment of the degree distribution . Quick consensus thus arises on networks with broad degree distributions . We also identify the conservation law that characterizes the route by which consensus is reached . Parallel results are derived for the invasion process , in which the state of an agent is `` exported '' to a random neighbor . We further generalize to biased dynamics in which one state is favored . The probability for a single fitter mutant located at a node of degree k to overspread the population -- the fixation probability -- is proportional to k for the voter model and to 1/k for the invasion process .
0712.4304	physics.bio-ph cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.SC	Traffic of single-headed motor proteins KIF1A : effects of lane changing	KIF1A kinesins are single-headed motor proteins which move on cylindrical nano-tubes called microtubules ( MT ) . A normal MT consists of 13 protofilaments on which the equispaced motor binding sites form a periodic array . The collective movement of the kinesins on a MT is , therefore , analogous to vehicular traffic on multi-lane highways where each protofilament is the analogue of a single lane . Does lane-changing increase or decrease the motor flux per lane ? We address this fundamental question here by appropriately extending a recent model [ { \it Phys . Rev . E { \bf 75 } , 041905 ( 2007 ) } ] . By carrying out analytical calculations and computer simulations of this extended model , we predict that the flux per lane can increase or decrease with the increasing rate of lane changing , depending on the concentrations of motors and the rate of hydrolysis of ATP , the `` fuel '' molecules . Our predictions can be tested , in principle , by carrying out { \it in-vitro } experiments with fluorescently labelled KIF1A molecules .
