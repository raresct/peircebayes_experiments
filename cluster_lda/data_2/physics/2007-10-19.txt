We successfully demonstrated the concept for two Yb-doped fiber lasers at 1064nm and 1092nm up to a total input power of 90W . The results reveal a very good combining efficiency and the potential for scaling to high power operations in this method of beam combining .
0710.3653	physics.optics	Slow-light enhanced optical detection in liquid-infiltrated photonic crystals	Slow-light enhanced optical detection in liquid-infiltrated photonic crystals is theoretically studied . Using a scattering-matrix approach and the Wigner-Smith delay time concept , we show that optical absorbance benefits both from slow-light phenomena as well as a high filling factor of the energy residing in the liquid . Utilizing strongly dispersive photonic crystal structures , we numerically demonstrate how liquid-infiltrated photonic crystals facilitate enhanced light-matter interactions , by potentially up to an order of magnitude . The proposed concept provides strong opportunities for improving existing miniaturized absorbance cells for optical detection in lab-on-a-chip systems .

The aim of this monochromator is to reduce the intense gamma-radiation produced by conventional velocity selectors and to avoid a direct view of the guide while keeping a comparable neutron transmission ( higher than 70 % ) . The monochromator offers a continuous choice of wavelength selection in the range 0.5 to 2 nm .

Earlier a similar calculation was performed for the 4d $ ^2D_ { 5/2 } $ state of $ \mathrm { ^ { 88 } Sr^ { + } } $ which is the most accurate determination to date { [ } PRL , \textbf { 96 } , 193001 ( 2006 ) ] . The present calculation of the electric quadrupole moment of $ \mathrm { ^ { 171 } Yb^ { + } } $ yielded a value $ 2.157 ea_ { 0 } ^ { 2 } $ where the experimental value is $ 2.08 ( 11 ) ea_ { 0 } ^ { 2 } $ ; $ a_ { 0 } $ is the Bohr radius and $ e $ the elementary charge . We discuss in this paper our results in detail for $ ^ { 171 } { \rm Yb } ^ { + } $ and highlight the dominant correlation effects present . We have presented the effect of inner core excitations and their contribution to the electric quadrupole moment , which is a property sensitive to regions away from the nucleus .
0710.3671	physics.soc-ph	Modelling highway-traffic headway distributions using superstatistics	We study traffic clearance distributions ( i.e. , the instantaneous gap between successive vehicles ) and time headway distributions by applying Beck and Cohen 's superstatistics . We model the transition from free phase to congested phase with the increase of vehicle density as a transition from the Poisson statistics to that of the random matrix theory . We derive an analytic expression for the spacing distributions that interpolates from the Poisson distribution and Wigner 's surmise and apply it to the distributions of the nett distance and time gaps among the succeeding cars at different densities of traffic flow . The obtained distribution fits the experimental results for single-vehicle data of the Dutch freeway A9 and the German freeway A5 .
0710.3729	physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph	Direct Numerical Simulation of a separated channel flow with a smooth profile	A direct numerical simulation ( DNS ) of a channel flow with one curved surface was performed at moderate Reynolds number ( Re_tau = 395 at the inlet ) . The adverse pressure gradient was obtained by a wall curvature through a mathematical mapping from physical coordinates to Cartesian ones . The code , using spectral spanwise and normal discretization , combines the advantage of a good accuracy with a fast integration procedure compared to standard numerical procedures for complex geometries . The turbulent flow slightly separates on the profile at the lower curved wall and is at the onset of separation at the opposite flat wall . The thin separation bubble is characterized with a reversal flow fraction . Intense vortices are generated near the separation line on the lower wall but also at the upper wall . Turbulent normal stresses and kinetic energy budget are investigated along the channel .

Proton Radiography images and velocimetry data from experiments with seven different tin coupons of varying thickness are analyzed . Comparing experiments with identical samples allowed us to distinguish between repeatable and random features . Shapes and velocities of the main fragments are deterministic functions of the coupon thickness ; random differences exist only at a small scale . Velocities of the leading layer and of the main fragment differ by the same value independently of coupon thicknesses , which is likely related to the separation energy of metal layers .
0710.3759	physics.atom-ph	Selective Reflection Spectroscopy at the Interface between a Calcium Fluoride Window and Cs Vapour	A special vapour cell has been built , that allows the measurement of the atom-surface van der Waals interaction exerted by a CaF2 window at the interface with Cs vapour . Mechanical and thermal fragility of fluoride windows make common designs of vapour cells unpractical , so that we have developed an all-sapphire sealed cell with an internal CaF2 window . Although impurities were accidentally introduced when filling-up the prototype cell , leading to a line-broadening and shift , the selective reflection spectrum on the Cs D1 line ( 894 nm ) makes apparent the weak van der Waals surface interaction . The uncertainties introduced by the effects of these impurities in the van der Waals measurement are nearly eliminated when comparing the selective reflection signal at the CaF2 interface of interest , and at a sapphire window of the same cell . The ratio of the interaction respectively exerted by a sapphire interface and a CaF2 interface is found to be 0.55 $ \pm $ 0.25 , in good agreement with the theoretical evaluation of ~0.67 .
0710.3761	physics.optics	Extraordinary surface voltage effect in the invisibility cloak with an active device inside	The electromagnetic field solution for a spherical invisibility cloak with an active device inside is established . Extraordinary electric and magnetic surface voltages are induced at the inner boundary of a spherical cloak , which prevent electromagnetic waves from going out . The phase and handness of polarized waves obliquely incident on such boundaries is kept in the reflected waves . The surface voltages due to an electric dipole inside the concealed region are found equal to the auxiliary scalar potentials at the inner boundary , which consequently gain physical counterparts in this case .

While for homogeneous beams the whole system oscillates with a single frequency , any inhomogeneity leads to propagating transverse density waves which eventually result in a singular density build up , causing wave breaking and jet formation . The theory presented in this paper allows to analytically calculate the time at which the wave breaking takes place . It also gives a good estimate of the time necessary for the beam to relax into the final stationary state consisting of a cold core surrounded by a halo of highly energetic particles .

This is based upon Wesson's ( 1999 ) treatment of instanton formation in five dimensional cosmologies . Criteria for break up of this instanton is proposed due to a causal barrier derived from first principles From the Friedmann equation for scale factor evolution , with a discussion of how this can be linked to Seth Lloyd's treatment of computational bits of 'information ' in different periods of inflationary cosmology

The result is an algorithm that computes bounds on a minimization variant of local modularity . We also define the concept of an edge support and a new measure of the goodness of community structures with respect to this concept . We present preliminary results and note that our methods are massively parallelizable .
0710.3807	physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph	Directed destabilization of lysozyme in protic ionic liquids reveals a compact , low energy , soluble , reversibly-unfolding ( pre-fibril ) state	Recent demonstrations of extraordinary stabilization of proteins in mobile protic [ 1 ] and aprotic [ 2 ] ionic liquid solutions at ambient temperatures have raised hopes of new biopreservation and drug transportation technologies . Here we examine the relation of folded protein stability to the state of the transferred proton [ 1 ] , as determined by the N-H proton chemical shift , d ( N-H ) . We identify a range of d ( N-H ) in which the unfolded lysozyme refolds 97 % . Exceeding the stability range in the acid direction leads to the sudden formation and stabilization of a small , soluble , amyloid form of lysozyme which has its own stability range and which can again unfold/refold many times before an irreversible process , fibrillization , occurs . The tightly bound amyloid form of the lysozyme molecule , identified by circular dichroism spectra and dynamic light scattering , must be of very low energy since the unfolding process absorbs almost three times the enthalpy of normal lysozyme unfolding . alpha-lactalbumin shows similar behavior .
