Rev . A { \bf 75 } , 060102 ( R ) ( 2007 ) ; arXiv:0705.3793 ] claimed that they have performed a precision measurement of the Casimir force between a sphere and a plate coated with Au , both immersed in ethanol . The measurement results were claimed to be consistent with the Lifshitz theory . We demonstrate that the calculation of the Casimir force between the smooth bodies following the authors prescription has a discrepancy up to 25 % with respect to authors result . We show also that the attractive electrostatic force only due to the surface potential differences was underestimated by a factor of 590 and the charge double layer interaction was not taken into account . All this leads to the conclusion that the results of this experiment are in fact uncertain .
0708.1552	physics.optics	Demonstration of a mid infrared silicon Raman amplifier	We demonstrate for the first time a mid infrared silicon Raman amplifier . Amplification of 12 dB is reported for a signal at 3.39 micron wavelength . The active medium was a 2.5 cm long silicon sample that was pumped with 5ns pulses at 2.88 micron . The absence of the nonlinear losses which severely limit the performance of silicon Raman devices in the near infrared combined with unsurpassed crystal quality , high thermal conductivity render silicon a very attractive Raman medium . Such a technology can potentially extend silicon photonics application beyond data communication in the near infrared and into the mid infrared world of remote sensing , biochemical detection and laser medicine .
