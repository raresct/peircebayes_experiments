The new EoS was tested to experiments of perovskite 0-109 GPa and 293-2000 K. The parameters providing the best fit are : Ko = 267.5 GPa , Vo = 24.284 cm3 , alpha_o = 2.079x10^-5 K^-1 , the pressure derivative of Ko is 1.556 and the pressure derivative of alpha_o is -1.098x10^-7 K^-1GPa^-1 . The root-mean-square-deviations ( RMSD ) of the residuals are 0.043 cm3 , 0.79 GPa , and 125 K for the molar volume , pressure , and temperature respectively . These RMSD values are in the range of the uncertainty of the experiments , indicating that the five parameters semi-empirical EoS correctly describes the p-V-T relationships of perovskite . Separating the experiments into 200 K ranges the semi-empirical EoS was compared to the most widely used finite strain , interatomic potential , and empirical isothermal EoSs such as the Birch-Murnaghan , the Vinet , and the Roy-Roy respectively . Correlation coefficients , RMSDs of the residuals and Akaike Information Criteria were used for evaluating the fitting . Based on these fitting parameters under pure isothermal conditions the semi-empirical p-V EoS is slightly weaker than the Birch-Murnaghan and Vinet EoSs ; however , the semi-empirical p-V-T EoS is superior in every temperature range to all of the investigated conventional isothermal EoSs .
