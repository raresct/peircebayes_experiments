0704.1011	physics.flu-dyn	Modal Extraction in Spatially Extended Systems	We describe a practical procedure for extracting the spatial structure and the growth rates of slow eigenmodes of a spatially extended system , using a unique experimental capability both to impose and to perturb desired initial states . The procedure is used to construct experimentally the spectrum of linear modes near the secondary instability boundary in Rayleigh-B\ ' { e } nard convection . This technique suggests an approach to experimental characterization of more complex dynamical states such as periodic orbits or spatiotemporal chaos .
