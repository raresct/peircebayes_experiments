0710.3907	physics.soc-ph	Impacts of preference and geography on epidemic spreading	We investigate the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible model on a random network to study the effects of preference and geography on diseases spreading . The network grows by introducing one random node with $ m $ links on a Euclidean space at unit time . The probability of a new node $ i $ linking to a node $ j $ with degree $ k_j $ at distance $ d_ { ij } $ from node $ i $ is proportional to $ k_ { j } ^ { A } /d_ { ij } ^ { B } $ , where $ A $ and $ B $ are positive constants governing preferential attachment and the cost of the node-node distance . In the case of A=0 , we recover the usual epidemic behavior with a critical threshold below which diseases eventually die out . Whereas for B=0 , the critical behavior is absent only in the condition A=1 . While both ingredients are proposed simultaneously , the network becomes robust to infection for larger $ A $ and smaller $ B $ .
0710.3910	physics.atm-clus physics.atom-ph	On the photoionization of the outer electrons in noble gas endohedral atoms	We demonstrate the prominent modification of the outer shell photoionization cross-section in noble gas ( NG ) endohedral atoms NG @ F under the action of the fullerene F electron shell . This shell leads to two important effects , namely to strong enhancement of the cross-section due to fullerenes shell polarization under the action of the incoming electromagnetic wave and to prominent oscillation of this cross-section due to the reflection of the photoelectron from NG by the F shell . All but He noble gas atoms are considered . The polarization of the fullerene shell is expressed via the total photoabsorption cross-section of F. The reflection of the photoelectron is taken into account in the frame of the so-called bubble potential that is a spherical zero -- thickness potential . It is assumed in the derivations that NG is centrally located in the fullerene . It is assumed also , in accord with the existing experimental data , that the fullerenes radius R is much bigger than the atomic radius and the thickness of the fullerenes shell . These assumptions permit , as it was demonstrated recently , to present the NG @ F photoionization cross-section as a product of the NG cross-section and two well defined calculated factors .

This fact could have an interest for the explanation of the dark energy , and for the gravitational collapses .
