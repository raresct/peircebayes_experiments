Laser turbidity and particle imaging methods are used to measure the particle velocity fluctuations and the steady state concentration profiles . Using a wide range of particle and system sizes , we find that the measured gradients $ \nabla \phi $ , the fluctuation magnitudes $ \sigma_v $ , and their spatial correlation lengths $ \xi $ , are not uniform in the columns - they all show strongly $ z- $ dependent profiles . These profiles also display a scaling in which results from different particle sizes collapse together when plotted in the forms $ -a\nabla \phi ( z ) $ , $ \xi ( z ) /a $ , and $ \sigma_v ( z ) /v_p $ , demonstrating the universality of the particle dynamics and structure in steady state sedimentation . Our results are also used to test a recently proposed model for the correlation lengths $ \xi ( z ) $ in terms of the concentration stratification $ \nabla \phi ( z ) $ [ P.J . Mucha and M.P . Brenner , Phys . Fluids { \bf 15 } , 1305 ( 2003 ) ] , $ \xi ( z ) =c_0 a [ \phi S ( \phi ) ] ^ { 1/5 } [ -a\nabla\phi ( z ) ] ^ { -2/5 } $ . We find that the correlation lengths predicted by this model are in very good agreement with our measured values , showing that the origin of the fluctuation length $ \xi $ lies with the concentration stratification $ \nabla \phi $ .

A transition layer sandwiched between connected media is described using a model of a two-dimensional gas of quantum dots . Explicit analytical expressions for a surface optical soliton in the presence of single and biexciton transitions , depending on the magnetic permeability of the left-handed medium , are obtained with realistic parameters which can be reached in current experiments . It is shown that the sign of the total energy flow the surface mode depends on the material parameters of the quantum dots and the connected media .
