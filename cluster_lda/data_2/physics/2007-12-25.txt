The relativistic tensor function sets are expressed through the corresponding nonrelativistic and quasirelativistic orbitals . The analytical formulas for overlap integrals over relativistic tensor Slater orbitals with the same screening constants in coordinate space are also derived .

Integral cross sections are calculated for elastic electron collision as well as impact excitation of the 7 lowest excited electronic states . Also , differential cross sections are obtained for elastic collision and excitation of the a^1 Delta_g , b^1 Sigma_g^+ and B^3 Sigma_u^- states . The integrated cross section of optically allowed excitation of the B^3 Sigma_u^- state agrees reasonably well with the available theoretical result .
