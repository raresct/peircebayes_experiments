0710.2604	cs.DB	Efficient Skyline Querying with Variable User Preferences on Nominal Attributes	Current skyline evaluation techniques assume a fixed ordering on the attributes . However , dynamic preferences on nominal attributes are more realistic in known applications . In order to generate online response for any such preference issued by a user , we propose two methods of different characteristics . The first one is a semi-materialization method and the second is an adaptive SFS method . Finally , we conduct experiments to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithms .
