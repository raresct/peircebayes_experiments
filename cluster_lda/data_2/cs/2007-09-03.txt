0709.0170	cs.CG cs.DM	Untangling a Planar Graph	A straight-line drawing $ \delta $ of a planar graph $ G $ need not be plane , but can be made so by \emph { untangling } it , that is , by moving some of the vertices of $ G $ . Let shift $ ( G , \delta ) $ denote the minimum number of vertices that need to be moved to untangle $ \delta $ . We show that shift $ ( G , \delta ) $ is NP-hard to compute and to approximate . Our hardness results extend to a version of \textsc { 1BendPointSetEmbeddability } , a well-known graph-drawing problem . Further we define fix $ ( G , \delta ) =n-shift ( G , \delta ) $ to be the maximum number of vertices of a planar $ n $ -vertex graph $ G $ that can be fixed when untangling $ \delta $ . We give an algorithm that fixes at least $ \sqrt { ( ( \log n ) -1 ) /\log \log n } $ vertices when untangling a drawing of an $ n $ -vertex graph $ G $ . If $ G $ is outerplanar , the same algorithm fixes at least $ \sqrt { n/2 } $ vertices . On the other hand we construct , for arbitrarily large $ n $ , an $ n $ -vertex planar graph $ G $ and a drawing $ \delta_G $ of $ G $ with fix $ ( G , \delta_G ) \le \sqrt { n-2 } +1 $ and an $ n $ -vertex outerplanar graph $ H $ and a drawing $ \delta_H $ of $ H $ with fix $ ( H , \delta_H ) \le 2 \sqrt { n-1 } +1 $ . Thus our algorithm is asymptotically worst-case optimal for outerplanar graphs .

0709.0204	cs.GT	Capacity constraints and the inevitability of mediators in adword auctions	One natural constraint in the sponsored search advertising framework arises from the fact that there is a limit on the number of available slots , especially for the popular keywords , and as a result , a significant pool of advertisers are left out . We study the emergence of diversification in the adword market triggered by such capacity constraints in the sense that new market mechanisms , as well as , new for-profit agents are likely to emerge to combat or to make profit from the opportunities created by shortages in ad-space inventory . We propose a model where the additional capacity is provided by for-profit agents ( or , mediators ) , who compete for slots in the original auction , draw traffic , and run their own sub-auctions . The quality of the additional capacity provided by a mediator is measured by its { \it fitness } factor . We compute revenues and payoffs for all the different parties at a { \it symmetric Nash equilibrium } ( SNE ) when the mediator-based model is operated by a mechanism currently being used by Google and Yahoo ! , and then compare these numbers with those obtained at a corresponding SNE for the same mechanism , but without any mediators involved in the auctions . Such calculations allow us to determine the value of the additional capacity . Our results show that the revenue of the auctioneer , as well as the social value ( i.e . efficiency ) , always increase when mediators are involved ; moreover even the payoffs of { \em all } the bidders will increase if the mediator has a high enough fitness . Thus , our analysis indicates that there are significant opportunities for diversification in the internet economy and we should expect it to continue to develop richer structure , with room for different types of agents and mechanisms to coexist .
0709.0218	cs.DB q-bio.NC	Inferring Neuronal Network Connectivity using Time-constrained Episodes	Discovering frequent episodes in event sequences is an interesting data mining task . In this paper , we argue that this framework is very effective for analyzing multi-neuronal spike train data . Analyzing spike train data is an important problem in neuroscience though there are no data mining approaches reported for this . Motivated by this application , we introduce different temporal constraints on the occurrences of episodes . We present algorithms for discovering frequent episodes under temporal constraints . Through simulations , we show that our method is very effective for analyzing spike train data for unearthing underlying connectivity patterns .
0709.0223	cs.CY	Brief encounter networks	Many complex human and natural phenomena can usefully be represented as networks describing the relationships between individuals . While these relationships are typically intermittent , previous research has used network representations that aggregate the relationships at discrete intervals . However , such an aggregation discards important temporal information , thus inhibiting our understanding of the networks dynamic behaviour and evolution . We have recorded patterns of human urban encounter using Bluetooth technology thus retaining the temporal properties of this network . Here we show how this temporal information influences the structural properties of the network . We show that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free , leading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals . While previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in scale-free connectivity in aggregated network data , we found that scale-free connectivity results from the temporal properties of the network . In addition , we show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of non-expiring information , yet persistent encounters provide the means for sustaining time-expiring information through a network .
0709.0259	cs.IT math.IT	Spectrum Sensing in Wideband OFDM Cognitive Radios	In this paper , detection of the primary user ( PU ) signal in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( OFDM ) based cognitive radio ( CR ) system is addressed . According to the prior knowledge of the PU signal known to the detector , three detection algorithms based on the Neyman-Pearson philosophy are proposed . In the first case , a Gaussian PU signal with completely known probability density function ( PDF ) except for its received power is considered . The frequency band that the PU signal resides is also assumed known . Detection is performed individually at each OFDM sub-carrier possibly interfered by the PU signal , and the results are then combined to form a final decision . In the second case , the sub-carriers that the PU signal resides are known . Observations from all possibly interfered sub-carriers are considered jointly to exploit the fact that the presence of a PU signal interferers all of them simultaneously . In the last case , it is assumed no PU signal prior knowledge is available . The detection is involved with a search of the interfered band . The proposed detector is able to detect an abrupt power change when tracing along the frequency axis .
