We give a data structure that supports both operations in O ( 1 ) time on the RAM model and requires $ { \cal B } ( n , m ) + o ( n ) + O ( \lg \lg m ) $ bits to store a set of size $ n $ , where $ { \cal B } ( n , m ) = \ceil { \lg { m \choose n } } $ is the minimum number of bits required to store any $ n $ -element subset from a universe of size $ m $ . Previous dictionaries taking this space only supported ( yes/no ) membership queries in O ( 1 ) time . In the cell probe model we can remove the $ O ( \lg \lg m ) $ additive term in the space bound , answering a question raised by Fich and Miltersen , and Pagh . We present extensions and applications of our indexable dictionary data structure , including : An information-theoretically optimal representation of a $ k $ -ary cardinal tree that supports standard operations in constant time , A representation of a multiset of size $ n $ from $ \ { 0 , ... , m-1\ } $ in $ { \cal B } ( n , m+n ) + o ( n ) $ bits that supports ( appropriate generalizations of ) $ \Rank $ and $ \Select $ operations in constant time , and A representation of a sequence of $ n $ non-negative integers summing up to $ m $ in $ { \cal B } ( n , m+n ) + o ( n ) $ bits that supports prefix sum queries in constant time .
0705.0564	cs.IT math.IT	Rate Bounds for MIMO Relay Channels	This paper considers the multi-input multi-output ( MIMO ) relay channel where multiple antennas are employed by each terminal . Compared to single-input single-output ( SISO ) relay channels , MIMO relay channels introduce additional degrees of freedom , making the design and analysis of optimal cooperative strategies more complex . In this paper , a partial cooperation strategy that combines transmit-side message splitting and block-Markov encoding is presented . Lower bounds on capacity that improve on a previously proposed non-cooperative lower bound are derived for Gaussian MIMO relay channels .
0705.0588	cs.AI cs.DS	Clustering Co-occurrence of Maximal Frequent Patterns in Streams	One way of getting a better view of data is using frequent patterns . In this paper frequent patterns are subsets that occur a minimal number of times in a stream of itemsets . However , the discovery of frequent patterns in streams has always been problematic . Because streams are potentially endless it is in principle impossible to say if a pattern is often occurring or not . Furthermore the number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of the stream is lost quickly . The proposed approach will use clustering to facilitate the analysis of the structure of the stream . A clustering on the co-occurrence of patterns will give the user an improved view on the structure of the stream . Some patterns might occur so much together that they should form a combined pattern . In this way the patterns in the clustering will be the largest frequent patterns : maximal frequent patterns . Our approach to decide if patterns occur often together will be based on a method of clustering when only the distance between pairs is known . The number of maximal frequent patterns is much smaller and combined with clustering methods these patterns provide a good view on the structure of the stream .
0705.0593	cs.AI cs.DS	Clustering with Lattices in the Analysis of Graph Patterns	Mining frequent subgraphs is an area of research where we have a given set of graphs ( each graph can be seen as a transaction ) , and we search for ( connected ) subgraphs contained in many of these graphs . In this work we will discuss techniques used in our framework Lattice2SAR for mining and analysing frequent subgraph data and their corresponding lattice information . Lattice information is provided by the graph mining algorithm gSpan ; it contains all supergraph-subgraph relations of the frequent subgraph patterns -- and their supports . Lattice2SAR is in particular used in the analysis of frequent graph patterns where the graphs are molecules and the frequent subgraphs are fragments . In the analysis of fragments one is interested in the molecules where patterns occur . This data can be very extensive and in this paper we focus on a technique of making it better available by using the lattice information in our clustering . Now we can reduce the number of times the highly compressed occurrence data needs to be accessed by the user . The user does not have to browse all the occurrence data in search of patterns occurring in the same molecules . Instead one can directly see which frequent subgraphs are of interest .
0705.0599	cs.HC	NodeTrix : Hybrid Representation for Analyzing Social Networks	The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware capabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets become available . Unfortunately , the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily answer the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities . To address this problem , we present NodeTrix , a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations : node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network , while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities . A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques . These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections from either a node-link or a matrix , flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset , and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings . Finally , we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results .
0705.0602	cs.NE	Risk Assessment Algorithms Based On Recursive Neural Networks	The assessment of highly-risky situations at road intersections have been recently revealed as an important research topic within the context of the automotive industry . In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to compute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing model in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure . Specifically , the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear in a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic labeled graphs . The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an inductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network . Recursive neural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and non-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic graphs . The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well predefined scenarios . The major difference of our approach compared to others is expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk . Furthermore , the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized model of dynamical recurrent networks permit us , as we shall demonstrate , a sophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step for building future advanced intersection safety systems
0705.0612	cs.CY	Privacy - an Issue for eLearning ? A Trend Analysis Reflecting the Attitude of European eLearning Users	Availing services provided via the Internet became a widely accepted means in organising one 's life . Beside others , eLearning goes with this trend as well . But , while employing Internet service makes life more convenient , at the same time , it raises risks with respect to the protection of the users ' privacy . This paper analyses the attitudes of eLearning users towards their privacy by , initially , pointing out terminology and legal issues connected with privacy . Further , the concept and implementation as well as a result analysis of a conducted study is presented , which explores the problem area from different perspectives . The paper will show that eLearning users indeed care for the protection of their personal information when using eLearning services . However , their attitudes and behaviour slightly differ . In conclusion , we provide first approaches of assisting possibilities for users how to resolve the difference of requirements and their actual activities with respect to privacy protection .
0705.0635	cs.CG	Moving Walkways , Escalators , and Elevators	We study a simple geometric model of transportation facility that consists of two points between which the travel speed is high . This elementary definition can model shuttle services , tunnels , bridges , teleportation devices , escalators or moving walkways . The travel time between a pair of points is defined as a time distance , in such a way that a customer uses the transportation facility only if it is helpful . We give algorithms for finding the optimal location of such a transportation facility , where optimality is defined with respect to the maximum travel time between two points in a given set .
