0706.4375	cs.AI	A Robust Linguistic Platform for Efficient and Domain specific Web Content Analysis	Web semantic access in specific domains calls for specialized search engines with enhanced semantic querying and indexing capacities , which pertain both to information retrieval ( IR ) and to information extraction ( IE ) . A rich linguistic analysis is required either to identify the relevant semantic units to index and weight them according to linguistic specific statistical distribution , or as the basis of an information extraction process . Recent developments make Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) techniques reliable enough to process large collections of documents and to enrich them with semantic annotations . This paper focuses on the design and the development of a text processing platform , Ogmios , which has been developed in the ALVIS project . The Ogmios platform exploits existing NLP modules and resources , which may be tuned to specific domains and produces linguistically annotated documents . We show how the three constraints of genericity , domain semantic awareness and performance can be handled all together .
