0707.2160	cs.DS	Splay Trees , Davenport-Schinzel Sequences , and the Deque Conjecture	We introduce a new technique to bound the asymptotic performance of splay trees . The basic idea is to transcribe , in an indirect fashion , the rotations performed by the splay tree as a Davenport-Schinzel sequence S , none of whose subsequences are isomorphic to fixed forbidden subsequence . We direct this technique towards Tarjan 's deque conjecture and prove that n deque operations require O ( n alpha^* ( n ) ) time , where alpha^* ( n ) is the minimum number of applications of the inverse-Ackermann function mapping n to a constant . We are optimistic that this approach could be directed towards other open conjectures on splay trees such as the traversal and split conjectures .

A key finding of this work is that substantial improvements in reliability can be realized with a very short expected delay and a slightly longer ( but bounded ) worst-case decoding delay guarantee in communication systems where the transmitter has access to even one bit per coherence interval of causal CSI . While similar in spirit to the recent work on communication systems based on automatic repeat requests ( ARQ ) where decoding failure is known at the transmitter and leads to re-transmission , here transmit side-information is purely based on CSI . The findings reported here also lend further support to an emerging understanding that decoding delay ( related to throughput ) and codeword blocklength ( related to coding complexity and delays ) are distinctly different design parameters which can be tuned to control reliability .
