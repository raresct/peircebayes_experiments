0706.0300	cs.CV	Automatic Detection of Pulmonary Embolism using Computational Intelligence	This article describes the implementation of a system designed to automatically detect the presence of pulmonary embolism in lung scans . These images are firstly segmented , before alignment and feature extraction using PCA . The neural network was trained using the Hybrid Monte Carlo method , resulting in a committee of 250 neural networks and good results are obtained .
0706.0306	cs.DL	Submission of content to a digital object repository using a configurable workflow system	The prototype of a workflow system for the submission of content to a digital object repository is here presented . It is based entirely on open-source standard components and features a service-oriented architecture . The front-end consists of Java Business Process Management ( jBPM ) , Java Server Faces ( JSF ) , and Java Server Pages ( JSP ) . A Fedora Repository and a mySQL data base management system serve as a back-end . The communication between front-end and back-end uses a SOAP minimal binding stub . We describe the design principles and the construction of the prototype and discuss the possibilities and limitations of work ow creation by administrators . The code of the prototype is open-source and can be retrieved in the project escipub at http : //sourceforge.net
