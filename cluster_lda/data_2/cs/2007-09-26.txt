0709.4087	cs.CG math.CO	The Topology of Bendless Three-Dimensional Orthogonal Graph Drawing	We consider embeddings of 3-regular graphs into 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates , in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if two of their three coordinates are equal ( that is , if they lie on an axis-parallel line ) and such that no three points lie on the same axis-parallel line ; we call a graph with such an embedding an xyz graph } . We describe a correspondence between xyz graphs and face-colored embeddings of the graph onto two-dimensional manifolds , and we relate bipartiteness of the xyz graph to orientability of the underlying topological surface . Using this correspondence , we show that planar graphs are xyz graphs if and only if they are bipartite , cubic , and three-connected , and that it is NP-complete to determine whether an arbitrary graph is an xyz graph . We also describe an algorithm with running time O ( n 2^ { n/2 } ) for testing whether a given graph is an xyz graph .
0709.4117	cs.CC	Deciding Unambiguity and Sequentiality starting from a Finitely Ambiguous Max-Plus Automaton	Finite automata with weights in the max-plus semiring are considered . The main result is : it is decidable in an effective way whether a series that is recognized by a finitely ambiguous max-plus automaton is unambiguous , or is sequential . A collection of examples is given to illustrate the hierarchy of max-plus series with respect to ambiguity .
0709.4118	cs.LO	An efficient simulation algorithm based on abstract interpretation	A number of algorithms for computing the simulation preorder are available . Let Sigma denote the state space , - > the transition relation and Psim the partition of Sigma induced by simulation equivalence . The algorithms by Henzinger , Henzinger , Kopke and by Bloom and Paige run in O ( |Sigma||- > | ) -time and , as far as time-complexity is concerned , they are the best available algorithms . However , these algorithms have the drawback of a space complexity that is more than quadratic in the size of the state space . The algorithm by Gentilini , Piazza , Policriti -- subsequently corrected by van Glabbeek and Ploeger -- appears to provide the best compromise between time and space complexity . Gentilini et al . 's algorithm runs in O ( |Psim|^2|- > | ) -time while the space complexity is in O ( |Psim|^2 + |Sigma|log|Psim| ) . We present here a new efficient simulation algorithm that is obtained as a modification of Henzinger et al . 's algorithm and whose correctness is based on some techniques used in applications of abstract interpretation to model checking . Our algorithm runs in O ( |Psim||- > | ) -time and O ( |Psim||Sigma|log|Sigma| ) -space . Thus , this algorithm improves the best known time bound while retaining an acceptable space complexity that is in general less than quadratic in the size of the state space . An experimental evaluation showed good comparative results with respect to Henzinger , Henzinger and Kopke 's algorithm .
