Following recent work in the linear framework , only logics with a single variable are considered . The expressive power and the complexity of satisfiability of the resulting logics is investigated . As main result , the satisfiability problem for the hybrid versions of several branching-time logics is proved to be 2EXPTIME-complete . These branching-time logics range from strict fragments of CTL to extensions of CTL that can talk about the past and express fairness-properties . The complexity gap relative to CTL is explained by a corresponding succinctness result . To prove the upper bound , the automata-theoretic approach to branching-time logics is extended to hybrid logics , showing that non-emptiness of alternating one-pebble Buchi tree automata is 2EXPTIME-complete .
0708.1725	cs.HC	Design : One , but in different forms	This overview paper defends an augmented cognitively oriented generic-design hypothesis : there are both significant similarities between the design activities implemented in different situations and crucial differences between these and other cognitive activities ; yet , characteristics of a design situation ( related to the design process , the designers , and the artefact ) introduce specificities in the corresponding cognitive activities and structures that are used , and in the resulting designs . We thus augment the classical generic-design hypothesis with that of different forms of designing . We review the data available in the cognitive design research literature and propose a series of candidates underlying such forms of design , outlining a number of directions requiring further elaboration .
