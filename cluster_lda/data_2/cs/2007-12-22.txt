By choosing communication delay as the bifurcation parameter , we demonstrate that the system loses its stability and a Hopf bifurcation occurs when communication delay passes through a critical value . Moreover , the bifurcating periodic solution of system is calculated by means of perturbation methods . Discussion of stability of the periodic solutions involves the computation of Floquet exponents by considering the corresponding Poincare -Lindstedt series expansion . Finally , numerical simulations for verify the theoretical analysis are provided .

In this paper we provide a review of important results on this topic and its various special cases . We observe that the BNFP can be solved as a sequence of $ O ( \log n ) $ maximum flow problems . However , special augmenting path based algorithms for the maximum flow problem can be modified to obtain algorithms for the BNFP with the property that these variations and the corresponding maximum flow algorithms have identical worst case time complexity . On unit capacity network we show that BNFP can be solved in $ O ( \min \ { { m ( n\log n ) } ^ { { 2/3 } } , m^ { { 3/2 } } \sqrt { \log n } \ } ) $ . This improves the best available algorithm by a factor of $ \sqrt { \log n } $ . On unit capacity simple graphs , we show that BNFP can be solved in $ O ( m \sqrt { n \log n } ) $ time . As a consequence we have an $ O ( m \sqrt { n \log n } ) $ algorithm for the BTP with unit arc capacities .
0712.3870	cs.GT cs.PF	Substitute Valuations : Generation and Structure	Substitute valuations ( in some contexts called gross substitute valuations ) are prominent in combinatorial auction theory . An algorithm is given in this paper for generating a substitute valuation through Monte Carlo simulation . In addition , the geometry of the set of all substitute valuations for a fixed number of goods K is investigated . The set consists of a union of polyhedrons , and the maximal polyhedrons are identified for K=4 . It is shown that the maximum dimension of the maximal polyhedrons increases with K nearly as fast as two to the power K. Consequently , under broad conditions , if a combinatorial algorithm can present an arbitrary substitute valuation given a list of input numbers , the list must grow nearly as fast as two to the power K .
0712.3876	cs.DS	Explicit Non-Adaptive Combinatorial Group Testing Schemes	Group testing is a long studied problem in combinatorics : A small set of $ r $ ill people should be identified out of the whole ( $ n $ people ) by using only queries ( tests ) of the form `` Does set X contain an ill human ? `` . In this paper we provide an explicit construction of a testing scheme which is better ( smaller ) than any known explicit construction . This scheme has $ \bigT { \min [ r^2 \ln n , n ] } $ tests which is as many as the best non-explicit schemes have . In our construction we use a fact that may have a value by its own right : Linear error-correction codes with parameters $ [ m , k , \delta m ] _q $ meeting the Gilbert-Varshamov bound may be constructed quite efficiently , in $ \bigT { q^km } $ time .
