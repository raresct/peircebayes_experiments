0708.2544	cs.DM cs.DS	On the Complexity of the Minimum Cost Homomorphism Problem for Reflexive Multipartite Tournaments	For digraphs $ D $ and $ H $ , a mapping $ f : V ( D ) \dom V ( H ) $ is a homomorphism of $ D $ to $ H $ if $ uv\in A ( D ) $ implies $ f ( u ) f ( v ) \in A ( H ) . $ For a fixed digraph $ H $ , the homomorphism problem is to decide whether an input digraph $ D $ admits a homomorphism to $ H $ or not , and is denoted as HOMP ( $ H $ ) . Digraphs are allowed to have loops , but not allowed to have parallel arcs . A natural optimization version of the homomorphism problem is defined as follows . If each vertex $ u \in V ( D ) $ is associated with costs $ c_i ( u ) , i \in V ( H ) $ , then the cost of the homomorphism $ f $ is $ \sum_ { u\in V ( D ) } c_ { f ( u ) } ( u ) $ . For each fixed digraph $ H $ , we have the { \em minimum cost homomorphism problem for } $ H $ and denote it as MinHOMP ( $ H $ ) . The problem is to decide , for an input graph $ D $ with costs $ c_i ( u ) , $ $ u \in V ( D ) , i\in V ( H ) $ , whether there exists a homomorphism of $ D $ to $ H $ and , if one exists , to find one of minimum cost . In a recent paper , we posed a problem of characterizing polynomial time solvable and NP-hard cases of the minimum cost homomorphism problem for acyclic multipartite tournaments with possible loops ( w.p.l . ) . In this paper , we solve the problem for reflexive multipartite tournaments and demonstrate a considerate difficulty of the problem for the whole class of multipartite tournaments w.p.l . using , as an example , acyclic 3-partite tournaments of order 4 w.p.l.\footnote { This paper was submitted to Discrete Mathematics on April 6 , 2007 }
0708.2545	cs.DM cs.DS	Complexity of the Minimum Cost Homomorphism Problem for Semicomplete Digraphs with Possible Loops	For digraphs $ D $ and $ H $ , a mapping $ f : V ( D ) \dom V ( H ) $ is a homomorphism of $ D $ to $ H $ if $ uv\in A ( D ) $ implies $ f ( u ) f ( v ) \in A ( H ) . $ For a fixed digraph $ H $ , the homomorphism problem is to decide whether an input digraph $ D $ admits a homomorphism to $ H $ or not , and is denoted as HOM ( $ H $ ) . An optimization version of the homomorphism problem was motivated by a real-world problem in defence logistics and was introduced in \cite { gutinDAM154a } . If each vertex $ u \in V ( D ) $ is associated with costs $ c_i ( u ) , i \in V ( H ) $ , then the cost of the homomorphism $ f $ is $ \sum_ { u\in V ( D ) } c_ { f ( u ) } ( u ) $ . For each fixed digraph $ H $ , we have the { \em minimum cost homomorphism problem for } $ H $ and denote it as MinHOM ( $ H $ ) . The problem is to decide , for an input graph $ D $ with costs $ c_i ( u ) , $ $ u \in V ( D ) , i\in V ( H ) $ , whether there exists a homomorphism of $ D $ to $ H $ and , if one exists , to find one of minimum cost . Although a complete dichotomy classification of the complexity of MinHOM ( $ H $ ) for a digraph $ H $ remains an unsolved problem , complete dichotomy classifications for MinHOM ( $ H $ ) were proved when $ H $ is a semicomplete digraph \cite { gutinDAM154b } , and a semicomplete multipartite digraph \cite { gutinDAM } . In these studies , it is assumed that the digraph $ H $ is loopless . In this paper , we present a full dichotomy classification for semicomplete digraphs with possible loops , which solves a problem in \cite { gutinRMS } .\footnote { This paper was submitted to SIAM J.

0708.2566	cs.IT math.IT	Discrete Denoising with Shifts	We introduce S-DUDE , a new algorithm for denoising DMC-corrupted data . The algorithm , which generalizes the recently introduced DUDE ( Discrete Universal DEnoiser ) of Weissman et al. , aims to compete with a genie that has access , in addition to the noisy data , also to the underlying clean data , and can choose to switch , up to $ m $ times , between sliding window denoisers in a way that minimizes the overall loss . When the underlying data form an individual sequence , we show that the S-DUDE performs essentially as well as this genie , provided that $ m $ is sub-linear in the size of the data . When the clean data is emitted by a piecewise stationary process , we show that the S-DUDE achieves the optimum distribution-dependent performance , provided that the same sub-linearity condition is imposed on the number of switches . To further substantiate the universal optimality of the S-DUDE , we show that when the number of switches is allowed to grow linearly with the size of the data , \emph { any } ( sequence of ) scheme ( s ) fails to compete in the above senses . Using dynamic programming , we derive an efficient implementation of the S-DUDE , which has complexity ( time and memory ) growing only linearly with the data size and the number of switches $ m $ . Preliminary experimental results are presented , suggesting that S-DUDE has the capacity to significantly improve on the performance attained by the original DUDE in applications where the nature of the data abruptly changes in time ( or space ) , as is often the case in practice .

0708.2575	cs.IT math.IT	Rateless Coding for Gaussian Channels	A rateless code-i.e. , a rate-compatible family of codes-has the property that codewords of the higher rate codes are prefixes of those of the lower rate ones . A perfect family of such codes is one in which each of the codes in the family is capacity-achieving . We show by construction that perfect rateless codes with low-complexity decoding algorithms exist for additive white Gaussian noise channels . Our construction involves the use of layered encoding and successive decoding , together with repetition using time-varying layer weights . As an illustration of our framework , we design a practical three-rate code family . We further construct rich sets of near-perfect rateless codes within our architecture that require either significantly fewer layers or lower complexity than their perfect counterparts . Variations of the basic construction are also developed , including one for time-varying channels in which there is no a priori stochastic model .
