0707.1064	cs.IT math.IT	The Effect of Noise Correlation in AF Relay Networks	In wireless relay networks , noise at the relays can be correlated possibly due to common interference or noise propagation from preceding hops . In this work we consider a parallel relay network with noise correlation . For the relay strategy of amplify-and-forward ( AF ) , we determine the optimal rate maximizing relay gains when correlation knowledge is available at the relays . The effect of correlation on the performance of the relay networks is analyzed for the cases where full knowledge of correlation is available at the relays and when there is no knowledge about the correlation structure . Interestingly we find that , on the average , noise correlation is beneficial regardless of whether the relays know the noise covariance matrix or not . However , the knowledge of correlation can greatly improve the performance . Typically , the performance improvement from correlation knowledge increases with the relay power and the number of relays . With perfect correlation knowledge the system is capable of canceling interference if the number of interferers is less than the number of relays . For a dual-hop multiple access parallel network , we obtain closed form expressions for the maximum sum-rate and the optimal relay strategy . The relay optimization for networks with three hops is also considered . For any relay gains for the first stage relays , this represents a parallel relay network with correlated noise . Based on the result of two hop networks with noise correlation , we propose an algorithm for solving the relay optimization problem for three-hop networks .
0707.1083	cs.NI cs.IR	Delayed Correlations in Inter-Domain Network Traffic	To observe the evolution of network traffic correlations we analyze the eigenvalue spectra and eigenvectors statistics of delayed correlation matrices of network traffic counts time series . Delayed correlation matrix D is composed of the correlations between one variable in the multivariable time series and another at a time delay \tau . Inverse participation ratio ( IPR ) of eigenvectors of D deviates substantially from the IPR of eigenvectors of the equal time correlation matrix C. We relate this finding to the localization and discuss its importance for network congestion control . The time-lagged correlation pattern between network time series is preserved over a long time , up to 100\tau , where \tau=300 sec . The largest eigenvalue \lambda_ { max } of D and the corresponding IPR oscillate with two characteristic periods of 3\tau and 6\tau . The existence of delayed correlations between network time series fits well into the long range dependence ( LRD ) property of the network traffic . The ability to monitor and control the long memory processes is crucial since they impact the network performance . Injecting the random traffic counts between non-randomly correlated time series , we were able to break the picture of periodicity of \lambda_ { max } . In addition , we investigated influence of the periodic injections on both largest eigenvalue and the IPR , and addressed relevance of these indicators for the LRD and self-similarity of the network traffic .
0707.1095	cs.DS cs.DM	Better Algorithms and Bounds for Directed Maximum Leaf Problems	The { \sc Directed Maximum Leaf Out-Branching } problem is to find an out-branching ( i.e . a rooted oriented spanning tree ) in a given digraph with the maximum number of leaves . In this paper , we improve known parameterized algorithms and combinatorial bounds on the number of leaves in out-branchings . We show that \begin { itemize } \item every strongly connected digraph $ D $ of order $ n $ with minimum in-degree at least 3 has an out-branching with at least $ ( n/4 ) ^ { 1/3 } -1 $ leaves ; \item if a strongly connected digraph $ D $ does not contain an out-branching with $ k $ leaves , then the pathwidth of its underlying graph is $ O ( k\log k ) $ ; \item it can be decided in time $ 2^ { O ( k\log^2 k ) } \cdot n^ { O ( 1 ) } $ whether a strongly connected digraph on $ n $ vertices has an out-branching with at least $ k $ leaves . \end { itemize } All improvements use properties of extremal structures obtained after applying local search and of some out-branching decompositions .
0707.1099	cs.IT math.IT	Worst-Case Interactive Communication and Enhancing Sensor Network Lifetime	We are concerned with the problem of maximizing the worst-case lifetime of a data-gathering wireless sensor network consisting of a set of sensor nodes directly communicating with a base-station.We propose to solve this problem by modeling sensor node and base-station communication as the interactive communication between multiple correlated informants ( sensor nodes ) and a recipient ( base-station ) . We provide practical and scalable interactive communication protocols for data gathering in sensor networks and demonstrate their efficiency compared to traditional approaches . In this paper , we first develop a formalism to address the problem of worst-case interactive communication between a set of multiple correlated informants and a recipient . We realize that there can be different objectives to achieve in such a communication scenario and compute the optimal number of messages and bits exchanged to realize these objectives . Then , we propose to adapt these results in the context of single-hop data-gathering sensor networks . Finally , based on this proposed formalism , we propose a clustering based communication protocol for large sensor networks and demonstrate its superiority over a traditional clustering protocol .
