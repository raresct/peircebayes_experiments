Three criteria ( global / partial , social / nonsocial , absolute / relative ) are defined and used to describe the main characteristics of this type of autonomy . A software agent autonomous with regard to the mobility illustrates a possible implementation of this model .
0707.1588	cs.IT math.IT	A Tight Lower Bound to the Outage Probability of Discrete-Input Block-Fading Channels	In this correspondence , we propose a tight lower bound to the outage probability of discrete-input Nakagami-m block-fading channels . The approach permits an efficient method for numerical evaluation of the bound , providing an additional tool for system design . The optimal rate-diversity trade-off for the Nakagami-m block-fading channel is also derived and a tight upper bound is obtained for the optimal coding gain constant .
0707.1607	cs.DC	Cactus Framework : Black Holes to Gamma Ray Bursts	Gamma Ray Bursts ( GRBs ) are intense narrowly-beamed flashes of gamma-rays of cosmological origin . They are among the most scientifically interesting astrophysical systems , and the riddle concerning their central engines and emission mechanisms is one of the most complex and challenging problems of astrophysics today . In this article we outline our petascale approach to the GRB problem and discuss the computational toolkits and numerical codes that are currently in use and that will be scaled up to run on emerging petaflop scale computing platforms in the near future . Petascale computing will require additional ingredients over conventional parallelism . We consider some of the challenges which will be caused by future petascale architectures , and discuss our plans for the future development of the Cactus framework and its applications to meet these challenges in order to profit from these new architectures .
0707.1618	cs.HC cs.GR	The Trade-offs with Space Time Cube Representation of Spatiotemporal Patterns	Space time cube representation is an information visualization technique where spatiotemporal data points are mapped into a cube . Fast and correct analysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social visualization applications . Information visualization researchers have previously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in revealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users . The argument is based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed simultaneously to users , an effect difficult to achieve in other representations . However , to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time cube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has not been empirically validated . To fill this gap we report on a between-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response times when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a baseline 2D representation . For some simple questions the error rates were lower when using the baseline representation . For complex questions where the participants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of the dataset , the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as fast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline . These results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space time cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal patterns .
0707.1639	cs.SE	Interface groups and financial transfer architectures	Analytic execution architectures have been proposed by the same authors as a means to conceptualize the cooperation between heterogeneous collectives of components such as programs , threads , states and services . Interface groups have been proposed as a means to formalize interface information concerning analytic execution architectures . These concepts are adapted to organization architectures with a focus on financial transfers . Interface groups ( and monoids ) now provide a technique to combine interface elements into interfaces with the flexibility to distinguish between directions of flow dependent on entity naming . The main principle exploiting interface groups is that when composing a closed system of a collection of interacting components , the sum of their interfaces must vanish in the interface group modulo reflection . This certainly matters for financial transfer interfaces . As an example of this , we specify an interface group and within it some specific interfaces concerning the financial transfer architecture for a part of our local academic organization . Financial transfer interface groups arise as a special case of more general service architecture interfaces .
0707.1644	cs.DB cs.PF	Fast and Simple Relational Processing of Uncertain Data	This paper introduces U-relations , a succinct and purely relational representation system for uncertain databases . U-relations support attribute-level uncertainty using vertical partitioning . If we consider positive relational algebra extended by an operation for computing possible answers , a query on the logical level can be translated into , and evaluated as , a single relational algebra query on the U-relation representation . The translation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of number of operations and , in particular , number of joins . Standard techniques employed in off-the-shelf relational database management systems are effective for optimizing and processing queries on U-relations . In our experiments we show that query evaluation on U-relations scales to large amounts of data with high degrees of uncertainty .
0707.1714	cs.DS	Sampling Algorithms and Coresets for Lp Regression	The Lp regression problem takes as input a matrix $ A \in \Real^ { n \times d } $ , a vector $ b \in \Real^n $ , and a number $ p \in [ 1 , \infty ) $ , and it returns as output a number $ { \cal Z } $ and a vector $ x_ { opt } \in \Real^d $ such that $ { \cal Z } = \min_ { x \in \Real^d } ||Ax -b||_p = ||Ax_ { opt } -b||_p $ . In this paper , we construct coresets and obtain an efficient two-stage sampling-based approximation algorithm for the very overconstrained ( $ n \gg d $ ) version of this classical problem , for all $ p \in [ 1 , \infty ) $ . The first stage of our algorithm non-uniformly samples $ \hat { r } _1 = O ( 36^p d^ { \max\ { p/2+1 , p\ } +1 } ) $ rows of $ A $ and the corresponding elements of $ b $ , and then it solves the Lp regression problem on the sample ; we prove this is an 8-approximation . The second stage of our algorithm uses the output of the first stage to resample $ \hat { r } _1/\epsilon^2 $ constraints , and then it solves the Lp regression problem on the new sample ; we prove this is a $ ( 1+\epsilon ) $ -approximation . Our algorithm unifies , improves upon , and extends the existing algorithms for special cases of Lp regression , namely $ p = 1,2 $ . In course of proving our result , we develop two concepts -- well-conditioned bases and subspace-preserving sampling -- that are of independent interest .
0707.1715	cs.DM	Sources of Superlinearity in Davenport-Schinzel Sequences	A generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequence is one over a finite alphabet that contains no subsequences isomorphic to a fixed forbidden subsequence . One of the fundamental problems in this area is bounding ( asymptotically ) the maximum length of such sequences . Following Klazar , let Ex ( \sigma , n ) be the maximum length of a sequence over an alphabet of size n avoiding subsequences isomorphic to \sigma . It has been proved that for every \sigma , Ex ( \sigma , n ) is either linear or very close to linear ; in particular it is O ( n 2^ { \alpha ( n ) ^ { O ( 1 ) } } ) , where \alpha is the inverse-Ackermann function and O ( 1 ) depends on \sigma . However , very little is known about the properties of \sigma that induce superlinearity of \Ex ( \sigma , n ) . In this paper we exhibit an infinite family of independent superlinear forbidden subsequences . To be specific , we show that there are 17 prototypical superlinear forbidden subsequences , some of which can be made arbitrarily long through a simple padding operation . Perhaps the most novel part of our constructions is a new succinct code for representing superlinear forbidden subsequences .
0707.1716	cs.NA cs.MS	Numerical Calculation With Arbitrary Precision	The vast use of computers on scientific numerical computation makes the awareness of the limited precision that these machines are able to provide us an essential matter . A limited and insufficient precision allied to the truncation and rounding errors may induce the user to incorrect interpretation of his/hers answer . In this work , we have developed a computational package to minimize this kind of error by offering arbitrary precision numbers and calculation . This is very important in Physics where we can work with numbers too small and too big simultaneously .
