0709.1771	cs.CV	Variational local structure estimation for image super-resolution	Super-resolution is an important but difficult problem in image/video processing . If a video sequence or some training set other than the given low-resolution image is available , this kind of extra information can greatly aid in the reconstruction of the high-resolution image . The problem is substantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand . The image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is insufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to oversmooth images with essentially no noise . We propose a new adaptive linear interpolation method based on variational method and inspired by local linear embedding ( LLE ) . The experimental result shows that our method avoids the problem of oversmoothing and preserves image structures well .
0709.1794	cs.DM	Overlap-free words and spectra of matrices	Overlap-free words are words over the binary alphabet $ A=\ { a , b\ } $ that do not contain factors of the form $ xvxvx $ , where $ x \in A $ and $ v \in A^* $ . We analyze the asymptotic growth of the number $ u_n $ of overlap-free words of length $ n $ as $ n \to \infty $ . We obtain explicit formulas for the minimal and maximal rates of growth of $ u_n $ in terms of spectral characteristics ( the lower spectral radius and the joint spectral radius ) of certain sets of matrices of dimension $ 20 \times 20 $ . Using these descriptions we provide new estimates of the rates of growth that are within 0.4 % and $ 0.03 % $ of their exact values . The best previously known bounds were within 11 % and 3 % respectively . We then prove that the value of $ u_n $ actually has the same rate of growth for `` almost all '' natural numbers $ n $ . This `` average '' growth is distinct from the maximal and minimal rates and can also be expressed in terms of a spectral quantity ( the Lyapunov exponent ) . We use this expression to estimate it . In order to obtain our estimates , we introduce new algorithms to compute spectral characteristics of sets of matrices . These algorithms can be used in other contexts and are of independent interest .
0709.1920	cs.CV	Bandwidth selection for kernel estimation in mixed multi-dimensional spaces	Kernel estimation techniques , such as mean shift , suffer from one major drawback : the kernel bandwidth selection . The bandwidth can be fixed for all the data set or can vary at each points . Automatic bandwidth selection becomes a real challenge in case of multidimensional heterogeneous features . This paper presents a solution to this problem . It is an extension of \cite { Comaniciu03a } which was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient . The selection is done iteratively for each type of features , by looking for the stability of local bandwidth estimates across a predefined range of bandwidths . A pseudo balloon mean shift filtering and partitioning are introduced . The validity of the method is demonstrated in the context of color image segmentation based on a 5-dimensional space .
0709.1941	cs.CG	Speeding up Simplification of Polygonal Curves using Nested Approximations	We develop a multiresolution approach to the problem of polygonal curve approximation . We show theoretically and experimentally that , if the simplification algorithm A used between any two successive levels of resolution satisfies some conditions , the multiresolution algorithm MR will have a complexity lower than the complexity of A . In particular , we show that if A has a O ( N2/K ) complexity ( the complexity of a reduced search dynamic solution approach ) , where N and K are respectively the initial and the final number of segments , the complexity of MR is in O ( N ) .We experimentally compare the outcomes of MR with those of the optimal `` full search '' dynamic programming solution and of classical merge and split approaches . The experimental evaluations confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed approach evaluated on 2D coastal maps either shows a lower complexity or provides polygonal approximations closer to the initial curves .
0709.1942	cs.CG cs.DM	Connecting Polygonizations via Stretches and Twangs	We show that the space of polygonizations of a fixed planar point set S of n points is connected by O ( n^2 ) `` moves '' between simple polygons . Each move is composed of a sequence of atomic moves called `` stretches '' and `` twangs '' . These atomic moves walk between weakly simple `` polygonal wraps '' of S. These moves show promise to serve as a basis for generating random polygons .
