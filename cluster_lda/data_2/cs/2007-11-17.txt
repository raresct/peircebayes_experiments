Although the areas of Human Computer Interaction ( HCI ) , CSCW , and CSCL are now relatively well established , the related field of Computer Supported Collaborative Research ( CSCR ) is new and little understood . An analysis of the principles and issues behind CSCR is undertaken with a view to determining precisely its nature and scope and to delineate it clearly from CSCW and CSCL . This determination is such that it is generally applicable to the building , design and evaluation of collaborative research environments . A particular instance of the CSCR domain is then examined in order to determine the requirements of a collaborative research environment for students and supervisors ( CRESS ) .
0711.2762	cs.IT math.IT	Variations on Information Embedding in Multiple Access and Broadcast Channels	Information embedding ( IE ) is the transmission of information within a host signal subject to a distortion constraint . There are two types of embedding methods , namely irreversible IE and reversible IE , depending upon whether or not the host , as well as the message , is recovered at the decoder . In irreversible IE , only the embedded message is recovered at the decoder , and in reversible IE , both the message and the host are recovered at the decoder . This paper considers combinations of irreversible and reversible IE in multiple access channels ( MAC ) and physically degraded broadcast channels ( BC ) .
