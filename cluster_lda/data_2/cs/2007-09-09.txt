We consider the problem of enumerating the Nash equilibria in ( non-degenerate ) games of rank 1 . In particular , we show that even for games of rank 1 not all equilibria can be reached by a Lemke-Howson path and present a parametric simplex-type algorithm for enumerating all Nash equilibria of a non-degenerate game of rank 1 .

Fine grain parallelism becomes a major requirement and introduces the necessity of loose synchronization in the parallel execution of an operation . This paper presents an algorithm for the Cholesky , LU and QR factorization where the operations can be represented as a sequence of small tasks that operate on square blocks of data . These tasks can be dynamically scheduled for execution based on the dependencies among them and on the availability of computational resources . This may result in an out of order execution of the tasks which will completely hide the presence of intrinsically sequential tasks in the factorization . Performance comparisons are presented with the LAPACK algorithms where parallelism can only be exploited at the level of the BLAS operations and vendor implementations .
