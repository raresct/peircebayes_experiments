0705.0199	cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV	The Parameter-Less Self-Organizing Map algorithm	The Parameter-Less Self-Organizing Map ( PLSOM ) is a new neural network algorithm based on the Self-Organizing Map ( SOM ) . It eliminates the need for a learning rate and annealing schemes for learning rate and neighbourhood size . We discuss the relative performance of the PLSOM and the SOM and demonstrate some tasks in which the SOM fails but the PLSOM performs satisfactory . Finally we discuss some example applications of the PLSOM and present a proof of ordering under certain limited conditions .
0705.0204	cs.DS	Using Images to create a Hierarchical Grid Spatial Index	This paper presents a hybrid approach to spatial indexing of two dimensional data . It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional algorithms as working with images . Inspiration is drawn from an analogous situation that is found in machine and human vision . Image processing techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data . A fixed grid approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically . Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records . This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data . The bucketing quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for each layer . The results show that this method performs better than the quad tree if there are more divisions per layer . This confirms our suspicions that the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher resolution images . An elegant class structure is developed where the implementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely relies on rendering the data onto an image .

Optimal power allocation schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the literature . We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is given by the Singleton bound . We also illustrate the significant gains available by employing long-term power constraints . Due to the nature of the expressions involved , the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation . We propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage probability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability obtained by optimal schemes .

While there is no known polynomial time algorithm for solving it optimally there are many good heuristics that all provide additive errors to optimal . The additive error in these algorithms usually depends linearly upon the largest encoding letter size . This paper was motivated by the problem of finding optimal codes when the encoding alphabet is infinite . Because the largest letter cost is infinite , the previous analyses could give infinite error bounds . We provide a new algorithm that works with infinite encoding alphabets . When restricted to the finite alphabet case , our algorithm often provides better error bounds than the best previous ones known .
0705.0262	cs.GT	The Complexity of Games on Higher Order Pushdown Automata	We prove an n-EXPTIME lower bound for the problem of deciding the winner in a reachability game on Higher Order Pushdown Automata ( HPDA ) of level n. This bound matches the known upper bound for parity games on HPDA . As a consequence the mu-calculus model checking over graphs given by n-HPDA is n-EXPTIME complete .
0705.0281	cs.DB	Dynamic Clustering in Object-Oriented Databases : An Advocacy for Simplicity	We present in this paper three dynamic clustering techniques for Object-Oriented Databases ( OODBs ) . The first two , Dynamic , Statistical & Tunable Clustering ( DSTC ) and StatClust , exploit both comprehensive usage statistics and the inter-object reference graph . They are quite elaborate . However , they are also complex to implement and induce a high overhead . The third clustering technique , called Detection & Reclustering of Objects ( DRO ) , is based on the same principles , but is much simpler to implement . These three clustering algorithm have been implemented in the Texas persistent object store and compared in terms of clustering efficiency ( i.e. , overall performance increase ) and overhead using the Object Clustering Benchmark ( OCB ) . The results obtained showed that DRO induced a lighter overhead while still achieving better overall performance .
0705.0286	cs.IT math.IT	Inverse-free Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata Algorithm and Small Decoders for Algebraic-Geometric Codes	This paper proposes a novel algorithm for finding error-locators of algebraic-geometric codes that can eliminate the division-calculations of finite fields from the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm . This inverse-free algorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors , generic errors , which includes most errors , and can decode codes on algebraic curves without the determination of unknown syndromes . Moreover , we propose three different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to , and we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each clock-timing with numerical simulations . We estimate the performance in comparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and shift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for codes on algebraic curves .
0705.0315	cs.NI math.CO	WDM and Directed Star Arboricity	A digraph is $ m $ -labelled if every arc is labelled by an integer in $ \ { 1 , \dots , m\ } $ . Motivated by wavelength assignment for multicasts in optical networks , we introduce and study $ n $ -fibre colourings of labelled digraphs . These are colourings of the arcs of $ D $ such that at each vertex $ v $ , and for each colour $ \alpha $ , $ in ( v , \alpha ) +out ( v , \alpha ) \leq n $ with $ in ( v , \alpha ) $ the number of arcs coloured $ \alpha $ entering $ v $ and $ out ( v , \alpha ) $ the number of labels $ l $ such that there is at least one arc of label $ l $ leaving $ v $ and coloured with $ \alpha $ . The problem is to find the minimum number of colours $ \lambda_n ( D ) $ such that the $ m $ -labelled digraph $ D $ has an $ n $ -fibre colouring . In the particular case when $ D $ is $ 1 $ -labelled , $ \lambda_1 ( D ) $ is called the directed star arboricity of $ D $ , and is denoted by $ dst ( D ) $ . We first show that $ dst ( D ) \leq 2\Delta^- ( D ) +1 $ , and conjecture that if $ \Delta^- ( D ) \geq 2 $ , then $ dst ( D ) \leq 2\Delta^- ( D ) $ . We also prove that for a subcubic digraph $ D $ , then $ dst ( D ) \leq 3 $ , and that if $ \Delta^+ ( D ) , \Delta^- ( D ) \leq 2 $ , then $ dst ( D ) \leq 4 $ . Finally , we study $ \lambda_n ( m , k ) =\max\ { \lambda_n ( D ) \tq D \mbox { is $ m $ -labelled } \et \Delta^- ( D ) \leq k\ } $ . We show that if $ m\geq n $ , then $ \ds \left\lceil\frac { m } { n } \left\lceil \frac { k } { n } \right\rceil + \frac { k } { n } \right\rceil\leq \lambda_n ( m , k ) \leq\left\lceil\frac { m } { n } \left\lceil \frac { k } { n } \right\rceil + \frac { k } { n } \right\rceil + C \frac { m^2\log k } { n } $ for some constant $ C $ . We conjecture that the lower bound should be the right value of $ \lambda_n ( m , k ) $ .

In this paper , we extend the results to other mobility models including two-dimensional hybrid random walk model , one-dimensional i.i.d . mobility model and one-dimensional hybrid random walk model . We consider both fast mobiles and slow mobiles , and establish the optimal delay-throughput trade-offs under some conditions . Joint coding-scheduling algorithms are also proposed to achieve the optimal trade-offs .
