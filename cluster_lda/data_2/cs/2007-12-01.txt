In particular , we establish the following simple connection between the redundancy $ R $ and the number of bits $ W $ necessary for representation of source 's probabilities in computer 's memory ( $ R $ is assumed to be small ) : \begin { equation* } W \lesssim \eta \log_2 \frac { m } { R } , \end { equation* } where $ m $ is the cardinality of the source's alphabet , and $ \eta \leqslant 1 $ is an implementation-specific constant . In case of binary alphabets ( $ m=2 $ ) we show that there exist codes for which $ \eta = 1/2 $ , and in $ m $ -ary case ( $ m > 2 $ ) we show that there exist codes for which $ \eta = m/ ( m+1 ) $ . In general case , however ( which includes designs relying on progressive updates of frequency counters ) , we show that $ \eta = 1 $ . Usefulness of these results for practical designs of source coding algorithms is also discussed .

Addition becomes idempotent and multiplication is interpreted as a selection operation . We also show that mnesors can be the foundation for a linear calculus .

In this work we construct word-based codes , for which $ R \lesssim \bar N^ { -5/3 } $ . Therefore , word-based codes can attain the same redundancy as block-codes while being much less complex . We also consider uniform on the output codes , the benefit of which is the lack of a running synchronization error . For such codes $ \bar N^ { -1 } \lesssim R \lesssim \bar N^ { -1 } $ , except for a case when all input symbols are equiprobable , when $ R \leqslant \bar N^ { -2 } $ for infinitely many $ \bar N $ .

Documented spreadsheet error rates are unacceptable in corporations today . Although improvements are needed throughout the systems development life cycle , credible improvement programs must include comprehensive testing . Several forms of testing are possible , but logic inspection is recommended for module testing . Logic inspection appears to be feasible for spreadsheet developers to do , and logic inspection appears to be safe and effective .

In such systems , where there is hardly any link with our common-sense view of the world , and it is quite difficult to envision how one can formally account for the considerable amount of content that is often implicit , but almost never explicitly stated in our everyday discourse . The solution , in our opinion , is a compositional semantics grounded in an ontology that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way we talk about it in ordinary language . In the compositional logic we envision there are ontological ( or first-intension ) concepts , and logical ( or second-intension ) concepts , and where the ontological concepts include not only Davidsonian events , but other abstract objects as well ( e.g. , states , processes , properties , activities , attributes , etc . ) It will be demonstrated here that in such a framework , a number of challenges in the semantics of natural language ( e.g. , metonymy , intensionality , metaphor , etc . ) can be properly and uniformly addressed .
