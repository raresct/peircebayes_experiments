0709.3257	cs.DM	Series which are both max-plus and min-plus rational are unambiguous	Consider partial maps from the free monoid into the field of real numbers with a rational domain . We show that two families of such series are actually the same : the unambiguous rational series on the one hand , and the max-plus and min-plus rational series on the other hand . The decidability of equality was known to hold in both families with different proofs , so the above unifies the picture . We give an effective procedure to build an unambiguous automaton from a max-plus automaton and a min-plus one that recognize the same series .
0709.3262	cs.IT math.IT	A software for learning Information Theory basics with emphasis on Entropy of Spanish	In this paper , a tutorial software to learn Information Theory basics in a practical way is reported . The software , called IT-tutor-UV , makes use of a modern existing Spanish corpus for the modeling of the source . Both the source and the channel coding are also included in this educational tool as part of the learning experience . Entropy values of the Spanish language obtained with the IT-tutor-UV are discussed and compared to others that were previously calculated under limited conditions .
