0708.2974	cs.CV cs.CR	The Fuzzy Vault for fingerprints is Vulnerable to Brute Force Attack	The \textit { fuzzy vault } approach is one of the best studied and well accepted ideas for binding cryptographic security into biometric authentication . The vault has been implemented in connection with fingerprint data by Uludag and Jain . We show that this instance of the vault is vulnerable to brute force attack . An interceptor of the vault data can recover both secret and template data using only generally affordable computational resources . Some possible alternatives are then discussed and it is suggested that cryptographic security may be preferable to the one - way function approach to biometric security .
0708.3014	cs.CR cs.CC	Explicit formulas for efficient multiplication in F_ { 3^ { 6m } }	Efficient computation of the Tate pairing is an important part of pairing-based cryptography . Recently with the introduction of the Duursma-Lee method special attention has been given to the fields of characteristic 3 . Especially multiplication in F_ { 3^ { 6m } } , where m is prime , is an important operation in the above method . In this paper we propose a new method to reduce the number of F_ { 3^m } multiplications for multiplication in F_ { 3^ { 6m } } from 18 in recent implementations to 15 . The method is based on the fast Fourier tranmsform and explicit formulas are given . The execution times of our software implementations for F_ { 3^ { 6m } } show the efficiency of our results .

A relay network with N relays and a single source-destination pair is called a partially-coherent relay channel ( PCRC ) if the destination has perfect channel state information ( CSI ) of all the channels and the relays have only the phase information of the source-to-relay channels . In this paper , first , a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a STBC to be SSD for co-located multiple antenna communication is obtained . Then , this is extended to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a distributed STBC ( DSTBC ) to be SSD for a PCRC , by identifying the additional conditions . Using this , several SSD DSTBCs for PCRC are identified among the known classes of STBCs . It is proved that even if a SSD STBC for a co-located MIMO channel does not satisfy the additional conditions for the code to be SSD for a PCRC , single-symbol decoding of it in a PCRC gives full-diversity and only coding gain is lost . It is shown that when a DSTBC is SSD for a PCRC , then arbitrary coordinate interleaving of the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of the variables does not disturb its SSD property for PCRC . Finally , it is shown that the possibility of { \em channel phase compensation } operation at the relay nodes using partial CSI at the relays increases the possible rate of SSD DSTBCs from $ \frac { 2 } { N } $ when the relays do not have CSI to 1/2 , which is independent of N .
0708.3022	cs.CR	Efficient FPGA-based multipliers for F_ { 3^97 } and F_ { 3^ { 6*97 } }	In this work we present a new structure for multiplication in finite fields . This structure is based on a digit-level LFSR ( Linear Feedback Shift Register ) multiplier in which the area of digit-multipliers are reduced using the Karatsuba method . We compare our results with the other works in the literature for F_ { 3^97 } . We also propose new formulas for multiplication in F_ { 3^ { 6*97 } } . These new formulas reduce the number of F_ { 3^97 } -multiplications from 18 to 15 . The fields F_ { 3^ { 97 } } and F_ { 3^ { 6*97 } } are relevant in the context of pairing-based cryptography .

The requirement for small delay and jitter of voice traffic poses a significant challenge for medium access control ( MAC ) in such networks . User mobility makes it more complex due to the associated dynamic path attenuation . In this paper , a MAC scheme for mobile ad hoc networks supporting voice traffic is proposed . With the aid of a low-power probe prior to DATA transmissions , resource reservation is achieved in a distributed manner , thus leading to small delay and jitter . The proposed scheme can automatically adapt to dynamic path attenuation in a mobile environment . Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme .
0708.3070	cs.IT math.IT	Network Coding Capacity of Random Wireless Networks under a Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Model	In this paper , we study network coding capacity for random wireless networks . Previous work on network coding capacity for wired and wireless networks have focused on the case where the capacities of links in the network are independent . In this paper , we consider a more realistic model , where wireless networks are modeled by random geometric graphs with interference and noise . In this model , the capacities of links are not independent . We consider two scenarios , single source multiple destinations and multiple sources multiple destinations . In the first scenario , employing coupling and martingale methods , we show that the network coding capacity for random wireless networks still exhibits a concentration behavior around the mean value of the minimum cut under some mild conditions . Furthermore , we establish upper and lower bounds on the network coding capacity for dependent and independent nodes . In the second one , we also show that the network coding capacity still follows a concentration behavior . Our simulation results confirm our theoretical predictions .
