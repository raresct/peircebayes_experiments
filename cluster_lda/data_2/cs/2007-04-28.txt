0704.3780	cs.NE	Stochastic Optimization Algorithms	When looking for a solution , deterministic methods have the enormous advantage that they do find global optima . Unfortunately , they are very CPU-intensive , and are useless on untractable NP-hard problems that would require thousands of years for cutting-edge computers to explore . In order to get a result , one needs to revert to stochastic algorithms , that sample the search space without exploring it thoroughly . Such algorithms can find very good results , without any guarantee that the global optimum has been reached ; but there is often no other choice than using them . This chapter is a short introduction to the main methods used in stochastic optimization .
