0711.2780	cs.NI	Epcast : Controlled Dissemination in Human-based Wireless Networks by means of Epidemic Spreading Models	Epidemics-inspired techniques have received huge attention in recent years from the distributed systems and networking communities . These algorithms and protocols rely on probabilistic message replication and redundancy to ensure reliable communication . Moreover , they have been successfully exploited to support group communication in distributed systems , broadcasting , multicasting and information dissemination in fixed and mobile networks . However , in most of the existing work , the probability of infection is determined heuristically , without relying on any analytical model . This often leads to unnecessarily high transmission overheads . In this paper we show that models of epidemic spreading in complex networks can be applied to the problem of tuning and controlling the dissemination of information in wireless ad hoc networks composed of devices carried by individuals , i.e. , human-based networks . The novelty of our idea resides in the evaluation and exploitation of the structure of the underlying human network for the automatic tuning of the dissemination process in order to improve the protocol performance . We evaluate the results using synthetic mobility models and real human contacts traces .

Bat'iViews : une interface multi-vues orient\'ee gestion de chantier	Cooperation between actors in design and construction activities in architecture is an essential stake nowadays . In professional practices the actors involved in construction projects use numerous tools . The project is unique but the `` views '' that actors manipulate are various and sometimes fundamentally different . Their common characteristic is that they partially represent the cooperation context through a specific point of view . `` Bat'iViews '' suggests to the actors a multi-view interface of the context and enables to navigate through the different views . This proposition is based on a model-driven approach . We distinguish between `` context modelling '' and modelling of concepts represented in each `` businessview '' . A model integrative infrastructure allows us to develop the prototype and to manage user interaction through the definition of models ' transformations .

We derive a general outerbound on the degrees of freedom \emph { region } of these networks . When all nodes have a single antenna and all channel coefficients vary in time or frequency , we show that the \emph { total } number of degrees of freedom of the $ X $ network is equal to $ \frac { MN } { M+N-1 } $ per orthogonal time and frequency dimension . Achievability is proved by constructing interference alignment schemes for $ X $ networks that can come arbitrarily close to the outerbound on degrees of freedom . For the case where either M=2 or N=2 we find that the outerbound is exactly achievable . While $ X $ networks have significant degrees of freedom benefits over interference networks when the number of users is small , our results show that as the number of users increases , this advantage disappears . Thus , for large $ K $ , the $ K\times K $ user wireless $ X $ network loses half the degrees of freedom relative to the $ K\times K $ MIMO outerbound achievable through full cooperation . Interestingly , when there are few transmitters sending to many receivers ( $ N\gg M $ ) or many transmitters sending to few receivers ( $ M\gg N $ ) , $ X $ networks are able to approach the $ \min ( M , N ) $ degrees of freedom possible with full cooperation on the $ M\times N $ MIMO channel . Similar to the interference channel , we also construct an example of a 2 user $ X $ channel with propagation delays where the outerbound on degrees of freedom is achieved through interference alignment based on a simple TDMA strategy .
0711.2842	cs.CY	A new approach for scientific data dissemination in developing countries : a case of Indonesia	This short paper is intended as an additional progress report to share our experiences in Indonesia on collecting , integrating and disseminating both global and local scientific data across the country through the web technology . Our recent efforts are exerted on improving the local public access to global scientific data , and on the other hand encouraging the local scientific data to be more accessible for the global communities . We have maintained well-connected infrastructure and some web-based information management systems to realize such objectives . This paper is especially focused on introducing the ARSIP for mirroring global as well as sharing local scientific data , and the newly developed Indonesian Scientific Index for integrating local scientific data through an automated intelligent indexing system .
