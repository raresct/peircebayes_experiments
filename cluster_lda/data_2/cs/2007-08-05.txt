0708.0660	cs.NI cs.GR	Network synchronizability analysis : the theory of subgraphs and complementary graphs	In this paper , subgraphs and complementary graphs are used to analyze the network synchronizability . Some sharp and attainable bounds are provided for the eigenratio of the network structural matrix , which characterizes the network synchronizability , especially when the network 's corresponding graph has cycles , chains , bipartite graphs or product graphs as its subgraphs .
0708.0694	cs.IR cs.CL cs.DL	Reconstruction of Protein-Protein Interaction Pathways by Mining Subject-Verb-Objects Intermediates	The exponential increase in publication rate of new articles is limiting access of researchers to relevant literature . This has prompted the use of text mining tools to extract key biological information . Previous studies have reported extensive modification of existing generic text processors to process biological text . However , this requirement for modification had not been examined . In this study , we have constructed Muscorian , using MontyLingua , a generic text processor . It uses a two-layered generalization-specialization paradigm previously proposed where text was generically processed to a suitable intermediate format before domain-specific data extraction techniques are applied at the specialization layer . Evaluation using a corpus and experts indicated 86-90 % precision and approximately 30 % recall in extracting protein-protein interactions , which was comparable to previous studies using either specialized biological text processing tools or modified existing tools . Our study had also demonstrated the flexibility of the two-layered generalization-specialization paradigm by using the same generalization layer for two specialized information extraction tasks .
