0707.4289	cs.AI	A Leaf Recognition Algorithm for Plant Classification Using Probabilistic Neural Network	In this paper , we employ Probabilistic Neural Network ( PNN ) with image and data processing techniques to implement a general purpose automated leaf recognition algorithm . 12 leaf features are extracted and orthogonalized into 5 principal variables which consist the input vector of the PNN . The PNN is trained by 1800 leaves to classify 32 kinds of plants with an accuracy greater than 90 % . Compared with other approaches , our algorithm is an accurate artificial intelligence approach which is fast in execution and easy in implementation .
0707.4298	cs.CG math.FA	A note on equipartition	The problem of the existence of an equi-partition of a curve in $ \R^n $ has recently been raised in the context of computational geometry . The problem is to show that for a ( continuous ) curve $ \Gamma : [ 0,1 ] \to \R^n $ and for any positive integer N , there exist points $ t_0=0 < t_1 < ... < t_ { N-1 } < 1=t_N $ , such that $ d ( \Gamma ( t_ { i-1 } ) , \Gamma ( t_i ) ) =d ( \Gamma ( t_ { i } ) , \Gamma ( t_ { i+1 } ) ) $ for all $ i=1 , ... , N $ , where d is a metric or even a semi-metric ( a weaker notion ) on $ \R^n $ . We show here that the existence of such points , in a broader context , is a consequence of Brower 's fixed point theorem .
0707.4304	cs.DB	Spatial Aggregation : Data Model and Implementation	Data aggregation in Geographic Information Systems ( GIS ) is only marginally present in commercial systems nowadays , mostly through ad-hoc solutions . In this paper , we first present a formal model for representing spatial data . This model integrates geographic data and information contained in data warehouses external to the GIS . We define the notion of geometric aggregation , a general framework for aggregate queries in a GIS setting . We also identify the class of summable queries , which can be efficiently evaluated by precomputing the overlay of two or more of the thematic layers involved in the query . We also sketch a language , denoted GISOLAP-QL , for expressing queries that involve GIS and OLAP features . In addition , we introduce Piet , an implementation of our proposal , that makes use of overlay precomputation for answering spatial queries ( aggregate or not ) . Our experimental evaluation showed that for a certain class of geometric queries with or without aggregation , overlay precomputation outperforms R-tree-based techniques . Finally , as a particular application of our proposal , we study topological queries .
0707.4311	cs.IT math.IT	Embedded Rank Distance Codes for ISI channels	Designs for transmit alphabet constrained space-time codes naturally lead to questions about the design of rank distance codes . Recently , diversity embedded multi-level space-time codes for flat fading channels have been designed from sets of binary matrices with rank distance guarantees over the binary field by mapping them onto QAM and PSK constellations . In this paper we demonstrate that diversity embedded space-time codes for fading Inter-Symbol Interference ( ISI ) channels can be designed with provable rank distance guarantees . As a corollary we obtain an asymptotic characterization of the fixed transmit alphabet rate-diversity trade-off for multiple antenna fading ISI channels . The key idea is to construct and analyze properties of binary matrices with a particular structure induced by ISI channels .
