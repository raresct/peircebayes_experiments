In this paper , an approach to developing some advanced architecture and modeling tools is presented to allow multiple frameworks work together while being shielded from the application program . This architecture is being developed in a framework of workbench interactive tools for next generation nanoparticle-reinforced damping/dynamic systems . Through the use of system , an engineer/programmer can respectively concentrate on tailoring an engineering design concept of novel system and the application software design while using existing databases/software outputs .

The inherent redundancy due to oversampling in Delta-Sigma quantization , and the simple linear-additive noise model resulting from dithered lattice quantization , allow us to construct a symmetric and time-invariant MD coding scheme . We show that the use of a noise shaping filter makes it possible to trade off central distortion for side distortion . Asymptotically as the dimension of the lattice vector quantizer and order of the noise shaping filter approach infinity , the entropy rate of the dithered Delta-Sigma quantization scheme approaches the symmetric two-channel MD rate-distortion function for a memoryless Gaussian source and MSE fidelity criterion , at any side-to-central distortion ratio and any resolution . In the optimal scheme , the infinite-order noise shaping filter must be minimum phase and have a piece-wise flat power spectrum with a single jump discontinuity . An important advantage of the proposed design is that it is symmetric in rate and distortion by construction , so the coding rates of the descriptions are identical and there is therefore no need for source splitting .
0708.1877	cs.IT math.IT	A nearly tight memory-redundancy trade-off for one-pass compression	Let $ s $ be a string of length $ n $ over an alphabet of constant size $ \sigma $ and let $ c $ and $ \epsilon $ be constants with ( 1 \geq c \geq 0 ) and ( \epsilon > 0 ) . Using ( O ( n ) ) time , ( O ( n^c ) ) bits of memory and one pass we can always encode $ s $ in ( n H_k ( s ) + O ( \sigma^k n^ { 1 - c + \epsilon } ) ) bits for all integers ( k \geq 0 ) simultaneously . On the other hand , even with unlimited time , using ( O ( n^c ) ) bits of memory and one pass we can not always encode $ s $ in ( O ( n H_k ( s ) + \sigma^k n^ { 1 - c - \epsilon } ) ) bits for , e.g. , ( k = \lceil ( c + \epsilon / 2 ) \log_\sigma n \rceil ) .

We show that the Voronoi diagram of n curves in R^d with k vertices each , has complexity Omega ( n^ { dk } ) for dimension d=1,2 and Omega ( n^ { d ( k-1 ) +2 } ) for d > 2 .
0708.1962	cs.AR cs.DC	Exact Cover with light	We suggest a new optical solution for solving the YES/NO version of the Exact Cover problem by using the massive parallelism of light . The idea is to build an optical device which can generate all possible solutions of the problem and then to pick the correct one . In our case the device has a graph-like representation and the light is traversing it by following the routes given by the connections between nodes . The nodes are connected by arcs in a special way which lets us to generate all possible covers ( exact or not ) of the given set . For selecting the correct solution we assign to each item , from the set to be covered , a special integer number . These numbers will actually represent delays induced to light when it passes through arcs . The solution is represented as a subray arriving at a certain moment in the destination node . This will tell us if an exact cover does exist or not .
0708.1964	cs.AR cs.AI cs.DC	Solving the subset-sum problem with a light-based device	We propose a special computational device which uses light rays for solving the subset-sum problem . The device has a graph-like representation and the light is traversing it by following the routes given by the connections between nodes . The nodes are connected by arcs in a special way which lets us to generate all possible subsets of the given set . To each arc we assign either a number from the given set or a predefined constant . When the light is passing through an arc it is delayed by the amount of time indicated by the number placed in that arc . At the destination node we will check if there is a ray whose total delay is equal to the target value of the subset sum problem ( plus some constants ) .
