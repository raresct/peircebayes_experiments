In this letter , we obtain that the WSLAS detector with a linear per-bit complexity achieves unit AME in the LRS-CDMA with a channel load < 1/2 - 1/ ( 4ln2 ) bits/s/Hz . For a practical system with any user number , a quasi LRS-CDMA is then proposed to approach the single-user performance in the high SNR regime .
0711.3869	cs.IT math.IT	A Family of Likelihood Ascent Search Multiuser Detectors : an Upper Bound of Bit Error Rate and a Lower Bound of Asymptotic Multiuser Efficiency	In this paper , the bit error performance of a family of likelihood ascent search ( LAS ) multiuser detectors is analyzed . An upper bound on the BER of any LAS detector is obtained by bounding the fixed point region with the worst initial detector . The concept of indecomposable errors developed by Verdu is applied to tighten the upper bound . In a special instance , the upper bound is reduced to that for all the local maximum likelihood detectors . The upper bound is comparable with that of the optimum detector obtained by Verdu . A lower bound on the asymptotic multiuser efficiency ( AME ) is then obtained . It is shown that there are nontrivial CDMA channels such that a LAS detector can achieve unit AME regardless of user number . The AME lower bound provides a means for further seeking a good set of spreading sequences and power distribution for spectral and power efficient CDMA .
