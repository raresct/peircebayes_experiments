0712.0271	cs.IT math.IT	Distributed Arithmetic Coding for the Asymmetric Slepian-Wolf problem	Distributed source coding schemes are typically based on the use of channels codes as source codes . In this paper we propose a new paradigm , termed '' distributed arithmetic coding '' , which exploits the fact that arithmetic codes are good source as well as channel codes . In particular , we propose a distributed binary arithmetic coder for Slepian-Wolf coding with decoder side information , along with a soft joint decoder . The proposed scheme provides several advantages over existing Slepian-Wolf coders , especially its good performance at small block lengths , and the ability to incorporate arbitrary source models in the encoding process , e.g . context-based statistical models . We have compared the performance of distributed arithmetic coding with turbo codes and low-density parity-check codes , and found that the proposed approach has very competitive performance .
0712.0305	cs.IT math.IT	The analytic computability of the Shannon transform for a large class of random matrix channels	We define a class of `` algebraic '' random matrix channels for which one can generically compute the limiting Shannon transform using numerical techniques and often enumerate the low SNR series expansion coefficients in closed form . We describe this class , the coefficient enumeration techniques and compare theory with simulations .

Using the multi-recursive version of this generator we can produce large number of pseudorandom sequences .
