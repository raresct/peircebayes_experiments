0711.2745	cs.IT math.IT	On Capacity Scaling in Arbitrary Wireless Networks	In recent work , Ozgur , Leveque , and Tse ( 2007 ) obtained a complete scaling characterization of throughput scaling for random extended wireless networks ( i.e. , $ n $ nodes are placed uniformly at random in a square region of area $ n $ ) . They showed that for small path-loss exponents $ \alpha\in ( 2,3 ] $ cooperative communication is order optimal , and for large path-loss exponents $ \alpha > 3 $ multi-hop communication is order optimal . However , their results ( both the communication scheme and the proof technique ) are strongly dependent on the regularity induced with high probability by the random node placement . In this paper , we consider the problem of characterizing the throughput scaling in extended wireless networks with arbitrary node placement . As a main result , we propose a more general novel cooperative communication scheme that works for arbitrarily placed nodes . For small path-loss exponents $ \alpha \in ( 2,3 ] $ , we show that our scheme is order optimal for all node placements , and achieves exactly the same throughput scaling as in Ozgur et al . This shows that the regularity of the node placement does not affect the scaling of the achievable rates for $ \alpha\in ( 2,3 ] $ . The situation is , however , markedly different for large path-loss exponents $ \alpha > 3 $ . We show that in this regime the scaling of the achievable per-node rates depends crucially on the regularity of the node placement . We then present a family of schemes that smoothly `` interpolate '' between multi-hop and cooperative communication , depending upon the level of regularity in the node placement . We establish order optimality of these schemes under adversarial node placement for $ \alpha > 3 $ .

In our approach , we consider image reference as a support of creation activity to generate ideas and we propose a tool for navigation in references by image in order to assist daylight ambience design . Within this paper , we present , in a first part , the semantic indexation method to be used for the indexation of our image database . In a second part we propose a synthetic analysis of various modes of referential navigation in order to propose a tool implementing all or a part of these modes .
0711.2835	cs.CG	Faster Algorithms for Rigidity in the Plane	In [ 1 ] , a new construction called red-black hierarchy characterizing Laman graphs and an algorithm for computing it were presented . For a Laman graph G= ( V , E ) with n vertices it runs in O ( n^2 ) time assuming that a partition of ( V , E+e ) into two spanning trees is given . We show that a simple modification reduces the running time to O ( n\log n ) . The total running time can be reduced O ( n\sqrt { n\log n } ) using the algorithm by Gabow and Westermann [ 2 ] for partitioning a graph into two forests . The existence of a red-black hierarchy is a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be a Laman graph . The algorithm for constructing a red-black hierarchy can be then modified to recognize Laman graphs in the same time .
0711.2843	cs.DM cs.CC	Complexity of the conditional colorability of graphs	For an integer $ r > 0 $ , a conditional $ ( k , r ) $ -coloring of a graph $ G $ is a proper $ k $ -coloring of the vertices of $ G $ such that every vertex $ v $ of degree $ d ( v ) $ in $ G $ is adjacent to vertices with at least $ min\ { r , d ( v ) \ } $ different colors . The smallest integer $ k $ for which a graph $ G $ has a conditional $ ( k , r ) $ -coloring is called the $ r $ th order conditional chromatic number , denoted by $ \chi_r ( G ) $ . It is easy to see that the conditional coloring is a generalization of the traditional vertex coloring for which $ r=1 $ . In this paper , we consider the complexity of the conditional colorings of graphs . The main result is that the conditional $ ( 3,2 ) $ -colorability is $ NP $ -complete for triangle-free graphs with maximum degree at most 3 , which is different from the old result that the traditional 3-colorability is polynomial solvable for graphs with maximum degree at most 3 . This also implies that it is $ NP $ -complete to determine if a graph of maximum degree 3 is $ ( 3,2 ) $ - or $ ( 4,2 ) $ -colorable . Also we have proved that some old complexity results for traditional colorings still hold for the conditional colorings .
0711.2844	cs.DM cs.CC	Dynamic 3-Coloring of Claw-free Graphs	A { \it dynamic $ k $ -coloring } of a graph $ G $ is a proper $ k $ -coloring of the vertices of $ G $ such that every vertex of degree at least 2 in $ G $ will be adjacent to vertices with at least 2 different colors . The smallest number $ k $ for which a graph $ G $ can have a dynamic $ k $ -coloring is the { \it dynamic chromatic number } , denoted by $ \chi_d ( G ) $ . In this paper , we investigate the dynamic 3-colorings of claw-free graphs . First , we prove that it is $ NP $ -complete to determine if a claw-free graph with maximum degree 3 is dynamically 3-colorable . Second , by forbidding a kind of subgraphs , we find a reasonable subclass of claw-free graphs with maximum degree 3 , for which the dynamically 3-colorable problem can be solved in linear time . Third , we give a linear time algorithm to recognize this subclass of graphs , and a linear time algorithm to determine whether it is dynamically 3-colorable . We also give a linear time algorithm to color the graphs in the subclass by 3 colors .

0711.2873	cs.IT math.IT	Trellis Computations	For a certain class of functions , the distribution of the function values can be calculated in the trellis or a sub-trellis . The forward/backward recursion known from the BCJR algorithm is generalized to compute the moments of these distributions . In analogy to the symbol probabilities , by introducing a constraint at a certain depth in the trellis we obtain symbol moments . These moments are required for an efficient implementation of the discriminated belief propagation algorithm in [ 2 ] , and can furthermore be utilized to compute conditional entropies in the trellis . The moment computation algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as the BCJR algorithm . It is applicable to any commutative semi-ring , thus actually providing a generalization of the Viterbi algorithm .
0711.2897	cs.NE	Estimation of fuzzy anomalies in Water Distribution Systems	State estimation is necessary in diagnosing anomalies in Water Demand Systems ( WDS ) . In this paper we present a neural network performing such a task . State estimation is performed by using optimization , which tries to reconcile all the available information . Quantification of the uncertainty of the input data ( telemetry measures and demand predictions ) can be achieved by means of robust estate estimation . Using a mathematical model of the network , fuzzy estimated states for anomalous states of the network can be obtained . They are used to train a neural network capable of assessing WDS anomalies associated with particular sets of measurements .
0711.2909	cs.AI cs.GT	Comparing the notions of optimality in CP-nets , strategic games and soft constraints	The notion of optimality naturally arises in many areas of applied mathematics and computer science concerned with decision making . Here we consider this notion in the context of three formalisms used for different purposes in reasoning about multi-agent systems : strategic games , CP-nets , and soft constraints . To relate the notions of optimality in these formalisms we introduce a natural qualitative modification of the notion of a strategic game . We show then that the optimal outcomes of a CP-net are exactly the Nash equilibria of such games . This allows us to use the techniques of game theory to search for optimal outcomes of CP-nets and vice-versa , to use techniques developed for CP-nets to search for Nash equilibria of the considered games . Then , we relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraints to that used in a generalization of strategic games , called graphical games . In particular we prove that for a natural class of soft constraints that includes weighted constraints every optimal solution is both a Nash equilibrium and Pareto efficient joint strategy . For a natural mapping in the other direction we show that Pareto efficient joint strategies coincide with the optimal solutions of soft constraints .
0711.2914	cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV	Image Classification Using SVMs : One-against-One Vs One-against-All	Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) are a relatively new supervised classification technique to the land cover mapping community . They have their roots in Statistical Learning Theory and have gained prominence because they are robust , accurate and are effective even when using a small training sample . By their nature SVMs are essentially binary classifiers , however , they can be adopted to handle the multiple classification tasks common in remote sensing studies . The two approaches commonly used are the One-Against-One ( 1A1 ) and One-Against-All ( 1AA ) techniques . In this paper , these approaches are evaluated in as far as their impact and implication for land cover mapping . The main finding from this research is that whereas the 1AA technique is more predisposed to yielding unclassified and mixed pixels , the resulting classification accuracy is not significantly different from 1A1 approach . It is the authors conclusion therefore that ultimately the choice of technique adopted boils down to personal preference and the uniqueness of the dataset at hand .

The Wikipedia category graph can be compared with the class hierarchy in an ontology ; it has some characteristics in common as well as some differences . In this paper , we present our approach for answering entity ranking queries from the Wikipedia . In particular , we explore how to make use of Wikipedia categories to improve entity ranking effectiveness . Our experiments show that using categories of example entities works significantly better than using loosely defined target categories .
0711.2961	cs.CC cs.GT cs.MA	Recognizing Members of the Tournament Equilibrium Set is NP-hard	A recurring theme in the mathematical social sciences is how to select the '' most desirable '' elements given a binary dominance relation on a set of alternatives . Schwartz 's tournament equilibrium set ( TEQ ) ranks among the most intriguing , but also among the most enigmatic , tournament solutions that have been proposed so far in this context . Due to its unwieldy recursive definition , little is known about TEQ . In particular , its monotonicity remains an open problem up to date . Yet , if TEQ were to satisfy monotonicity , it would be a very attractive tournament solution concept refining both the Banks set and Dutta 's minimal covering set . We show that the problem of deciding whether a given alternative is contained in TEQ is NP-hard .
0711.2971	cs.HC	IT services design to support coordination practices in the Luxembourguish AEC sector	In the Architecture Engineering and Construction sector ( AEC ) cooperation between actors is essential for project success . The configuration of actors' organization takes different forms like the associated coordination mechanisms . Our approach consists in analyzing these coordination mechanisms through the identification of the `` base practices '' realized by the actors of a construction project to cooperate . We also try with practitioners to highlight the `` best practices '' of cooperation . Then we suggest here two prototypes of IT services aiming to demonstrate the value added of IT to support cooperation . These prototype tools allow us to sensitize the actors through terrain experiments and then to bring inch by inch the Luxembourgish AEC sector towards electronic cooperation .
0711.2998	cs.DM	Optimizing diversity	We consider the problem of minimizing the size of a family of sets G such that every subset of 1 , ... , n can be written as a disjoint union of at most k members of G , where k and n are given numbers . This problem originates in a real-world application aiming at the diversity of industrial production . At the same time , the minimum of G so that every subset of 1 , ... , n is the union of two sets in G has been asked by Erdos and studied recently by Furedi and Katona without requiring the disjointness of the sets . A simple construction providing a feasible solution is conjectured to be optimal for this problem for all values of n and k and regardless of the disjointness requirement ; we prove this conjecture in special cases including all ( n , k ) for which n < = 3k holds , and some individual values of n and k .
