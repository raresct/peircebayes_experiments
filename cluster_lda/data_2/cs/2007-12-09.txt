0712.1337	cs.LO cs.DM	Axiomatizing rational power series	Iteration semirings are Conway semirings satisfying Conway 's group identities . We show that the semirings $ \N^ { \rat } \llangle \Sigma^* \rrangle $ of rational power series with coefficients in the semiring $ \N $ of natural numbers are the free partial iteration semirings . Moreover , we characterize the semirings $ \N_\infty^ { \rat } \llangle \Sigma^* \rrangle $ as the free semirings in the variety of iteration semirings defined by three additional simple identities , where $ \N_\infty $ is the completion of $ \N $ obtained by adding a point of infinity . We also show that this latter variety coincides with the variety generated by the complete , or continuous semirings . As a consequence of these results , we obtain that the semirings $ \N_\infty^ { \rat } \llangle \Sigma^* \rrangle $ , equipped with the sum order , are free in the class of symmetric inductive $ ^* $ -semirings . This characterization corresponds to Kozen's axiomatization of regular languages .

In particular , assuming that a linear multiuser detector is adopted in the uplink receiver , the case considered is that in which each terminal is allowed to vary its transmit power , spreading code , and uplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility , which is defined as the ratio of data throughput to transmit power . Resorting to a game-theoretic formulation , a non-cooperative game for utility maximization is formulated , and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium exists , which , under certain conditions , is also Pareto-optimal . Theoretical results concerning the relationship between the problems of SINR maximization and MSE minimization are given , and , resorting to the tools of large system analysis , a new distributed power control algorithm is implemented , based on very little prior information about the user of interest . The utility profile achieved by the active users in a large CDMA system is also computed , and , moreover , the centralized socially optimum solution is analyzed . Considerations on the extension of the proposed framework to a multi-cell scenario are also briefly detailed . Simulation results confirm that the proposed non-cooperative game largely outperforms competing alternatives , and that it exhibits a quite small performance loss with respect to the socially optimum solution , and only in the case in which the users number exceeds the processing gain . Finally , results also show an excellent agreement between the theoretical closed-form formulas based on large system analysis and the outcome of numerical experiments .
0712.1345	cs.LO cs.AI math.LO	Sequential operators in computability logic	Computability logic ( CL ) ( see http : //www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html ) is a semantical platform and research program for redeveloping logic as a formal theory of computability , as opposed to the formal theory of truth which it has more traditionally been . Formulas in CL stand for ( interactive ) computational problems , understood as games between a machine and its environment ; logical operators represent operations on such entities ; and `` truth '' is understood as existence of an effective solution , i.e. , of an algorithmic winning strategy . The formalism of CL is open-ended , and may undergo series of extensions as the study of the subject advances . The main groups of operators on which CL has been focused so far are the parallel , choice , branching , and blind operators . The present paper introduces a new important group of operators , called sequential . The latter come in the form of sequential conjunction and disjunction , sequential quantifiers , and sequential recurrences . As the name may suggest , the algorithmic intuitions associated with this group are those of sequential computations , as opposed to the intuitions of parallel computations associated with the parallel group of operations : playing a sequential combination of games means playing its components in a sequential fashion , one after one . The main technical result of the present paper is a sound and complete axiomatization of the propositional fragment of computability logic whose vocabulary , together with negation , includes all three -- parallel , choice and sequential -- sorts of conjunction and disjunction . An extension of this result to the first-order level is also outlined .
0712.1359	cs.LO cs.GT math.LO	Borel Ranks and Wadge Degrees of Context Free Omega Languages	We show that , from a topological point of view , considering the Borel and the Wadge hierarchies , 1-counter B\ '' uchi automata have the same accepting power than Turing machines equipped with a B\ '' uchi acceptance condition . In particular , for every non null recursive ordinal alpha , there exist some Sigma^0_alpha-complete and some Pi^0_alpha-complete omega context free languages accepted by 1-counter B\ '' uchi automata , and the supremum of the set of Borel ranks of context free omega languages is the ordinal gamma^1_2 which is strictly greater than the first non recursive ordinal . This very surprising result gives answers to questions of H. Lescow and W. Thomas [ Logical Specifications of Infinite Computations , In : '' A Decade of Concurrency '' , LNCS 803 , Springer , 1994 , p. 583-621 ] .
0712.1363	cs.LO cs.CC math.LO	Undecidable Problems About Timed Automata	We solve some decision problems for timed automata which were recently raised by S. Tripakis in [ Folk Theorems on the Determinization and Minimization of Timed Automata , in the Proceedings of the International Workshop FORMATS'2003 , LNCS , Volume 2791 , p. 182-188 , 2004 ] and by E. Asarin in [ Challenges in Timed Languages , From Applied Theory to Basic Theory , Bulletin of the EATCS , Volume 83 , p. 106-120 , 2004 ] . In particular , we show that one can not decide whether a given timed automaton is determinizable or whether the complement of a timed regular language is timed regular . We show that the problem of the minimization of the number of clocks of a timed automaton is undecidable . It is also undecidable whether the shuffle of two timed regular languages is timed regular . We show that in the case of timed B\ '' uchi automata accepting infinite timed words some of these problems are Pi^1_1-hard , hence highly undecidable ( located beyond the arithmetical hierarchy ) .
