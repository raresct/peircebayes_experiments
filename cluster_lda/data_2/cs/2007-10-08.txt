A new corpus has been compiled and made available , matching names against languages . This corpus is used in a series of experiments measuring the performance of general language models and names-only language models on the language identification task . Conclusions are drawn from the comparison between using general language models and names-only language models and between identifying the language of isolated names and the language of very short document fragments . Future research directions are outlined .
0710.1482	cs.PL cs.SE	Heap Reference Analysis for Functional Programs	Current garbage collectors leave a lot of garbage uncollected because they conservatively approximate liveness by reachability from program variables . In this paper , we describe a sequence of static analyses that takes as input a program written in a first-order , eager functional programming language , and finds at each program point the references to objects that are guaranteed not to be used in the future . Such references are made null by a transformation pass . If this makes the object unreachable , it can be collected by the garbage collector . This causes more garbage to be collected , resulting in fewer collections . Additionally , for those garbage collectors which scavenge live objects , it makes each collection faster . The interesting aspects of our method are both in the identification of the analyses required to solve the problem and the way they are carried out . We identify three different analyses -- liveness , sharing and accessibility . In liveness and sharing analyses , the function definitions are analyzed independently of the calling context . This is achieved by using a variable to represent the unknown context of the function being analyzed and setting up constraints expressing the effect of the function with respect to the variable . The solution of the constraints is a summary of the function that is parameterized with respect to a calling context and is used to analyze function calls . As a result we achieve context sensitivity at call sites without analyzing the function multiple number of times .

0710.1499	cs.DC	Approximating max-min linear programs with local algorithms	A local algorithm is a distributed algorithm where each node must operate solely based on the information that was available at system startup within a constant-size neighbourhood of the node . We study the applicability of local algorithms to max-min LPs where the objective is to maximise $ \min_k \sum_v c_ { kv } x_v $ subject to $ \sum_v a_ { iv } x_v \le 1 $ for each $ i $ and $ x_v \ge 0 $ for each $ v $ . Here $ c_ { kv } \ge 0 $ , $ a_ { iv } \ge 0 $ , and the support sets $ V_i = \ { v : a_ { iv } > 0 \ } $ , $ V_k = \ { v : c_ { kv } > 0 \ } $ , $ I_v = \ { i : a_ { iv } > 0 \ } $ and $ K_v = \ { k : c_ { kv } > 0 \ } $ have bounded size . In the distributed setting , each agent $ v $ is responsible for choosing the value of $ x_v $ , and the communication network is a hypergraph $ \mathcal { H } $ where the sets $ V_k $ and $ V_i $ constitute the hyperedges . We present inapproximability results for a wide range of structural assumptions ; for example , even if $ |V_i| $ and $ |V_k| $ are bounded by some constants larger than 2 , there is no local approximation scheme . To contrast the negative results , we present a local approximation algorithm which achieves good approximation ratios if we can bound the relative growth of the vertex neighbourhoods in $ \mathcal { H } $ .
0710.1522	cs.IT math.IT	Distributed spatial multiplexing with 1-bit feedback	We analyze a slow-fading interference network with MN non-cooperating single-antenna sources and M non-cooperating single-antenna destinations . In particular , we assume that the sources are divided into M mutually exclusive groups of N sources each , every group is dedicated to transmit a common message to a unique destination , all transmissions occur concurrently and in the same frequency band and a dedicated 1-bit broadcast feedback channel from each destination to its corresponding group of sources exists . We provide a feedback-based iterative distributed ( multi-user ) beamforming algorithm , which '' learns '' the channels between each group of sources and its assigned destination . This algorithm is a straightforward generalization , to the multi-user case , of the feedback-based iterative distributed beamforming algorithm proposed recently by Mudumbai et al. , in IEEE Trans . Inf . Th . ( submitted ) for networks with a single group of sources and a single destination . Putting the algorithm into a Markov chain context , we provide a simple convergence proof . We then show that , for M finite and N approaching infinity , spatial multiplexing based on the beamforming weights produced by the algorithm achieves full spatial multiplexing gain of M and full per-stream array gain of N , provided the time spent `` learning '' the channels scales linearly in N. The network is furthermore shown to `` crystallize '' . Finally , we characterize the corresponding crystallization rate .
0710.1525	cs.DS cs.IR	Efficient Optimally Lazy Algorithms for Minimal-Interval Semantics	Minimal-interval semantics associates with each query over a document a set of intervals , called witnesses , that are incomparable with respect to inclusion ( i.e. , they form an antichain ) : witnesses define the minimal regions of the document satisfying the query . Minimal-interval semantics makes it easy to define and compute several sophisticated proximity operators , provides snippets for user presentation , and can be used to rank documents . In this paper we provide algorithms for computing conjunction and disjunction that are linear in the number of intervals and logarithmic in the number of operands ; for additional operators , such as ordered conjunction and Brouwerian difference , we provide linear algorithms . In all cases , space is linear in the number of operands . More importantly , we define a formal notion of optimal laziness , and either prove it , or prove its impossibility , for each algorithm . Optimal laziness implies that the algorithms do not assume random access to the input intervals , and read as little input as possible to produce a certain output . We cast our results in the general framework of antichain completions of interval orders , making our algorithms directly applicable to other domains .
0710.1589	cs.IT math.IT	Fast Reliability-based Algorithm of Finding Minimum-weight Codewords for LDPC Codes	Despite the NP hardness of acquiring minimum distance $ d_m $ for linear codes theoretically , in this paper we propose one experimental method of finding minimum-weight codewords , the weight of which is equal to $ d_m $ for LDPC codes . One existing syndrome decoding method , called serial belief propagation ( BP ) with ordered statistic decoding ( OSD ) , is adapted to serve our purpose . We hold the conjecture that among many candidate error patterns in OSD reprocessing , modulo 2 addition of the lightest error pattern with one of the left error patterns may generate a light codeword . When the decoding syndrome changes to all-zero state , the lightest error pattern reduces to all-zero , the lightest non-zero error pattern is a valid codeword to update lightest codeword list . Given sufficient codewords sending , the survived lightest codewords are likely to be the target . Compared with existing techniques , our method demonstrates its efficiency in the simulation of several interested LDPC codes .
0710.1595	cs.IT math.IT	Analysis of Fixed Outage Transmission Schemes : A Finer Look at the Full Multiplexing Point	This paper studies the performance of transmission schemes that have rate that increases with average SNR while maintaining a fixed outage probability . This is in contrast to the classical Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff ( DMT ) that focuses on increasing rate and decreasing outage probability . Three different systems are explored : antenna diversity systems , time/frequency diversity systems , and automatic repeat request ( ARQ ) systems . In order to accurately study performance in the fixed outage setting , it is necesary to go beyond the coarse , asymptotic multiplexing gain metric . In the case of antenna diversity and time/frequency diversity , an affine approximation to high SNR outage capacity ( i.e. , multiplexing gain plus a power/rate offset ) accurately describes performance and shows the very significant benefits of diversity . ARQ is also seen to provide a significant performance advantage , but even an affine approximation to outage capacity is unable to capture this advantage and outage capacity must be directly studied in the non-asymptotic regime .
0710.1626	cs.IT math.IT	Throughput Scaling in Random Wireless Networks : A Non-Hierarchical Multipath Routing Strategy	Franceschetti et al . have recently shown that per-node throughput in an extended , ad hoc wireless network with $ \Theta ( n ) $ randomly distributed nodes and multihop routing can be increased from the $ \Omega ( { 1 \over \sqrt { n } \log n } ) $ scaling demonstrated in the seminal paper of Gupta and Kumar to $ \Omega ( { 1 \over \sqrt { n } } ) $ . The goal of the present paper is to understand the dependence of this interesting result on the principal new features it introduced relative to Gupta-Kumar : ( 1 ) a capacity-based formula for link transmission bit-rates in terms of received signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio ( SINR ) ; ( 2 ) hierarchical routing from sources to destinations through a system of communal highways ; and ( 3 ) cell-based routes constructed by percolation . The conclusion of the present paper is that the improved throughput scaling is principally due to the percolation-based routing , which enables shorter hops and , consequently , less interference . This is established by showing that throughput $ \Omega ( { 1 \over \sqrt { n } } ) $ can be attained by a system that does not employ highways , but instead uses percolation to establish , for each source-destination pair , a set of $ \Theta ( \log n ) $ routes within a narrow routing corridor running from source to destination . As a result , highways are not essential . In addition , it is shown that throughput $ \Omega ( { 1 \over \sqrt { n } } ) $ can be attained with the original threshold transmission bit-rate model , provided that node transmission powers are permitted to grow with $ n $ . Thus , the benefit of the capacity bit-rate model is simply to permit the power to remain bounded , even as the network expands .
