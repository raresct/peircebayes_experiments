We propose an algorithm based on Newton 's method and subdivision for this problem . Our algorithm is intended only for nondegenerate cases , in which case the solution is a 1-dimensional curve . Our first main contribution is a definition of a condition number measuring reciprocal distance to degeneracy that can distinguish poor and well conditioned instances of this problem . ( Degenerate problems would be infinitely ill conditioned in our framework . ) Our second contribution , which is the main novelty of our algorithm , is an analysis showing that its running time is bounded in terms of the condition number of the problem instance as well as $ n $ and the polynomial degrees .

Faliszewski et al . [ FHHR07 ] proved that Llull voting ( which is here denoted by Copeland^1 ) and a variant ( here denoted by Copeland^0 ) of Copeland voting are computationally resistant to many , yet not all , types of constructive control and that they also provide broad resistance to bribery . We study a parameterized version of Copeland voting , denoted by Copeland^alpha where the parameter alpha is a rational number between 0 and 1 that specifies how ties are valued in the pairwise comparisons of candidates in Copeland elections . We establish resistance or vulnerability results , in every previously studied control scenario , for Copeland^alpha , for each rational alpha , 0 < alpha < 1 . In particular , we prove that Copeland^0.5 , the system commonly referred to as `` Copeland voting , '' provides full resistance to constructive control . Among the systems with a polynomial-time winner problem , this is the first natural election system proven to have full resistance to constructive control . Results on bribery and fixed-parameter tractability of bounded-case control proven for Copeland^0 and Copeland^1 in [ FHHR07 ] are extended to Copeland^alpha for each rational alpha , 0 < alpha < 1 ; we also give results in more flexible models such as microbribery and extended control .

This paper focuses on the fundamental limits of operation of a MIMO cognitive radio network with a single licensed user and a single cognitive user . The channel setting is equivalent to an interference channel with degraded message sets ( with the cognitive user having access to the licensed user 's message ) . An achievable region and an outer bound is derived for such a network setting . It is shown that under certain conditions , the achievable region is optimal for a portion of the capacity region that includes sum capacity .

One obtains a generalization , namely orienteering with time-windows ( also referred to as TSP with time-windows ) , if each node v has a specified time-window [ R ( v ) , D ( v ) ] and a node v is counted as visited by the walk only if v is visited during its time-window . For the time-window problem , an O ( \log \opt ) approximation can be achieved even for directed graphs if the algorithm is allowed quasi-polynomial time . However , the best known polynomial time approximation ratios are O ( \log^2 \opt ) for undirected graphs and O ( \log^4 \opt ) in directed graphs . In this paper we make some progress towards closing this discrepancy , and in the process obtain improved approximation ratios in several natural settings . Let L ( v ) = D ( v ) - R ( v ) denote the length of the time-window for v and let \lmax = \max_v L ( v ) and \lmin = \min_v L ( v ) . Our results are given below with \alpha denoting the known approximation ratio for orienteering ( without time-windows ) . Currently \alpha = ( 2+\eps ) for undirected graphs and \alpha = O ( \log^2 \opt ) in directed graphs . 1 . An O ( \alpha \log \lmax ) approximation when R ( v ) and D ( v ) are integer valued for each v. 2 . An O ( \alpha \max { \log \opt , \log \frac { \lmax } { \lmin } } ) approximation . 3 . An O ( \alpha \log \frac { \lmax } { \lmin } ) approximation when no start and end points are specified . In particular , if \frac { \lmax } { \lmin } is poly-bounded , we obtain an O ( \log n ) approximation for the time-window problem in undirected graphs .
0711.4864	cs.IT math.IT	Cooperative Relaying with State Available at the Relay	We consider a state-dependent full-duplex relay channel with the state of the channel non-causally available at only the relay . In the framework of cooperative wireless networks , some specific terminals can be equipped with cognition capabilities , i.e , the relay in our model . In the discrete memoryless ( DM ) case , we derive lower and upper bounds on channel capacity . The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme at the relay that consists in a combination of codeword splitting , Gel'fand-Pinsker binning , and a decode-and-forward scheme . The upper bound is better than that obtained by assuming that the channel state is available at the source and the destination as well . For the Gaussian case , we also derive lower and upper bounds on channel capacity . The lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme which is based on a combination of codeword splitting and Generalized dirty paper coding . The upper bound is also better than that obtained by assuming that the channel state is available at the source , the relay , and the destination . The two bounds meet , and so give the capacity , in some special cases for the degraded Gaussian case .
