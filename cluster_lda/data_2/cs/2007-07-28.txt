To this end , we develop propositional proof systems under different measures of promises ( that is , different $ \Lam $ ) as extensions of resolution . This is done by augmenting resolution with axioms that , roughly , can eliminate sets of truth assignments defined by Boolean circuits . We then investigate the complexity of such systems , obtaining an exponential separation in the average-case between resolution under different size promises : 1 . Resolution has polynomial-size refutations for all unsatisfiable 3CNF formulas when the promise is $ \eps\cd2^n $ , for any constant $ 0 < \eps < 1 $ . 2 . There are no sub-exponential size resolution refutations for random 3CNF formulas , when the promise is $ 2^ { \delta n } $ ( and the number of clauses is $ o ( n^ { 3/2 } ) $ ) , for any constant $ 0 < \delta < 1 $ .
0707.4258	cs.CG cs.DM	Star Unfolding Convex Polyhedra via Quasigeodesic Loops	We extend the notion of star unfolding to be based on a quasigeodesic loop Q rather than on a point . This gives a new general method to unfold the surface of any convex polyhedron P to a simple ( non-overlapping ) , planar polygon : cut along one shortest path from each vertex of P to Q , and cut all but one segment of Q .
