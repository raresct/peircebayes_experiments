0705.3740	cs.CR	Optimal Iris Fuzzy Sketches	Fuzzy sketches , introduced as a link between biometry and cryptography , are a way of handling biometric data matching as an error correction issue . We focus here on iris biometrics and look for the best error-correcting code in that respect . We show that two-dimensional iterative min-sum decoding leads to results near the theoretical limits . In particular , we experiment our techniques on the Iris Challenge Evaluation ( ICE ) database and validate our findings .
0705.3748	cs.DM cs.CC	On the Obfuscation Complexity of Planar Graphs	Being motivated by John Tantalo 's Planarity Game , we consider straight line plane drawings of a planar graph $ G $ with edge crossings and wonder how obfuscated such drawings can be . We define $ obf ( G ) $ , the obfuscation complexity of $ G $ , to be the maximum number of edge crossings in a drawing of $ G $ . Relating $ obf ( G ) $ to the distribution of vertex degrees in $ G $ , we show an efficient way of constructing a drawing of $ G $ with at least $ obf ( G ) /3 $ edge crossings . We prove bounds $ ( \delta ( G ) ^2/24-o ( 1 ) ) n^2 < \obf G < 3 n^2 $ for an $ n $ -vertex planar graph $ G $ with minimum vertex degree $ \delta ( G ) \ge 2 $ . The shift complexity of $ G $ , denoted by $ shift ( G ) $ , is the minimum number of vertex shifts sufficient to eliminate all edge crossings in an arbitrarily obfuscated drawing of $ G $ ( after shifting a vertex , all incident edges are supposed to be redrawn correspondingly ) . If $ \delta ( G ) \ge 3 $ , then $ shift ( G ) $ is linear in the number of vertices due to the known fact that the matching number of $ G $ is linear . However , in the case $ \delta ( G ) \ge2 $ we notice that $ shift ( G ) $ can be linear even if the matching number is bounded . As for computational complexity , we show that , given a drawing $ D $ of a planar graph , it is NP-hard to find an optimum sequence of shifts making $ D $ crossing-free .
0705.3751	cs.DM cs.CC	On the expressive power of planar perfect matching and permanents of bounded treewidth matrices	Valiant introduced some 25 years ago an algebraic model of computation along with the complexity classes VP and VNP , which can be viewed as analogues of the classical classes P and NP . They are defined using non-uniform sequences of arithmetic circuits and provides a framework to study the complexity for sequences of polynomials . Prominent examples of difficult ( that is , VNP-complete ) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials . While the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials in general are difficult to evaluate , there have been research on which special cases of these polynomials admits efficient evaluation . For instance , Barvinok has shown that if the underlying matrix has bounded rank , both the permanent and the hamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time , and thus are in VP . Courcelle , Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded treewidth several difficult problems ( including evaluating the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials ) can be solved efficiently . An earlier result of this flavour is Kasteleyn 's theorem which states that the sum of weights of perfect matchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time , and thus is in VP also . For general graphs this problem is VNP-complete . In this paper we investigate the expressive power of the above results . We show that the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials for matrices of bounded treewidth both are equivalent to arithmetic formulas . Also , arithmetic weakly skew circuits are shown to be equivalent to the sum of weights of perfect matchings of planar graphs .
0705.3766	cs.NE cs.AI	On complexity of optimized crossover for binary representations	We consider the computational complexity of producing the best possible offspring in a crossover , given two solutions of the parents . The crossover operators are studied on the class of Boolean linear programming problems , where the Boolean vector of variables is used as the solution representation . By means of efficient reductions of the optimized gene transmitting crossover problems ( OGTC ) we show the polynomial solvability of the OGTC for the maximum weight set packing problem , the minimum weight set partition problem and for one of the versions of the simple plant location problem . We study a connection between the OGTC for linear Boolean programming problem and the maximum weight independent set problem on 2-colorable hypergraph and prove the NP-hardness of several special cases of the OGTC problem in Boolean linear programming .

The incident angles of a vertex $ p \in S $ of $ G $ are the angles between any two edges of $ G $ that appear consecutively in the circular order of the edges incident to $ p $ . A plane straight-line graph is called $ \phi $ -open if each vertex has an incident angle of size at least $ \phi $ . In this paper we study the following type of question : What is the maximum angle $ \phi $ such that for any finite set $ S\subset\R^2 $ of points in general position we can find a graph from a certain class of graphs on $ S $ that is $ \phi $ -open ? In particular , we consider the classes of triangulations , spanning trees , and paths on $ S $ and give tight bounds in most cases .
