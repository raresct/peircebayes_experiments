System performance is characterized by outage achievable rate regions . In contrast to most previous work , here the problem is studied under the key assumption that the transmitter only knows the probability distributions of the fading coefficients , but not their realizations . For scalar-input channels , two coding schemes are proposed . The first scheme is called blind dirty paper coding ( B-DPC ) , which utilizes a robustness property of dirty paper coding to perform precoding at the transmitter . The second scheme is called statistical superposition coding ( S-SC ) , in which each receiver adaptively performs successive decoding with the process statistically governed by the realized fading . Both B-DPC and S-SC schemes lead to the same outage achievable rate region , which always dominates that of time-sharing , irrespective of the particular fading distributions . The S-SC scheme can be extended to BCs with multiple transmit antennas .

New bounds are derived for the capacity of a given random ad hoc wireless network that reflect packet drop or capture probability of the transmission links . These bounds are based on a simplified network topology termed as honey-comb topology under a given routing and scheduling scheme .
