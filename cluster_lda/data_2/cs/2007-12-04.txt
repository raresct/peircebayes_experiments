Such stimuli receive the name of pseudowords or nonwords in the Cognitive Neuroscience literatue . The process for building nonwords sometimes has to be based on linguistic units such as syllables or morphemes , resulting in a numerical explosion of combinations when the size of the nonwords is increased . In this paper , a reactive tabu search scheme is proposed to generate nonwords of variables size . The approach builds pseudowords by using a modified Metaheuristic algorithm based on a local search procedure enhanced by a feedback-based scheme . Experimental results show that the new algorithm is a practical and effective tool for nonword generation .

We base rewrites on a historical click graph that records the ads that have been clicked on in response to past user queries . Given a query q , we first consider Simrank as a way to identify queries similar to q , i.e. , queries whose ads a user may be interested in . We argue that Simrank fails to properly identify query similarities in our application , and we present two enhanced version of Simrank : one that exploits weights on click graph edges and another that exploits `` evidence . '' We experimentally evaluate our new schemes against Simrank , using actual click graphs and queries form Yahoo ! , and using a variety of metrics . Our results show that the enhanced methods can yield more and better query rewrites .
0712.0531	cs.OH	Prostate biopsies guided by three-dimensional real-time ( 4-D ) transrectal ultrasonography on a phantom : comparative study versus two-dimensional transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies	OBJECTIVE : This study evaluated the accuracy in localisation and distribution of real-time three-dimensional ( 4-D ) ultrasound-guided biopsies on a prostate phantom . METHODS : A prostate phantom was created . A three-dimensional real-time ultrasound system with a 5.9MHz probe was used , making it possible to see several reconstructed orthogonal viewing planes in real time . Fourteen operators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound ( TRUS ) guidance ( 336 biopsies ) . The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation in a 3-D ultrasonographic volume . Special software was used to visualise the biopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area . A comparative study was performed to examine the accuracy of the entry points and target of the needle . Distribution was assessed by measuring the volume sampled and a redundancy ratio of the sampled prostate . RESULTS : A significant increase in accuracy in hitting the target zone was identified using 4-D ultrasonography as compared to 2-D . There was no increase in the sampled volume or improvement in the biopsy distribution with 4-D ultrasonography as compared to 2-D . CONCLUSION : The 4-D TRUS guidance appears to show , on a synthetic model , an improvement in location accuracy and in the ability to reproduce a protocol . The biopsy distribution does not seem improved .

These two-weight codes obtained are in the form of 2-generator quasi-cyclic , or quasi-twisted structure . Based on this construction , new optimal binary quasi-cyclic [ 195 , 8 , 96 ] , [ 210 , 8 , 104 ] and [ 240 , 8 , 120 ] codes , and good QC ternary [ 208 , 6 , 135 ] and [ 221 , 6 , 144 ] codes are thus obtained . It is also shown that many codes among the family meet the Griesmer bound and thereful are optimal .
0712.0554	cs.CG	Spanners of Complete $ k $ -Partite Geometric Graphs	We address the following problem : Given a complete $ k $ -partite geometric graph $ K $ whose vertex set is a set of $ n $ points in $ \mathbb { R } ^d $ , compute a spanner of $ K $ that has a `` small '' stretch factor and `` few '' edges . We present two algorithms for this problem . The first algorithm computes a $ ( 5+\epsilon ) $ -spanner of $ K $ with O ( n ) edges in $ O ( n \log n ) $ time . The second algorithm computes a $ ( 3+\epsilon ) $ -spanner of $ K $ with $ O ( n \log n ) $ edges in $ O ( n \log n ) $ time . The latter result is optimal : We show that for any $ 2 \leq k \leq n - \Theta ( \sqrt { n \log n } ) $ , spanners with $ O ( n \log n ) $ edges and stretch factor less than 3 do not exist for all complete $ k $ -partite geometric graphs .

A transformation on graphs is proposed , so that counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles of an undirected graph can be done by counting the number of Hamiltonian cycles of its corresponding symmetric directed graph . In this way , an upper bound for the number of Hamiltonian cycles of undirected graphs is also obtained .
