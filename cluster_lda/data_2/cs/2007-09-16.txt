0709.2506	cs.AI cs.DB	Autoencoder , Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Regression for Data Imputation	Data collection often results in records that have missing values or variables . This investigation compares 3 different data imputation models and identifies their merits by using accuracy measures . Autoencoder Neural Networks , Principal components and Support Vector regression are used for prediction and combined with a genetic algorithm to then impute missing variables . The use of PCA improves the overall performance of the autoencoder network while the use of support vector regression shows promising potential for future investigation . Accuracies of up to 97.4 % on imputation of some of the variables were achieved .

This paper addresses two related problems , namely , localization and stability . We localize a class with the cycle minimizing a certain objective function . We explore three different objective functions , namely , volume , diameter and radius . We show that it is NP-hard to compute the smallest cycle using the former two . We also prove that the measurement defined in the companion paper is stable with regard to small changes of the geometry of the concerned space .
