0712.1310	cs.LO cs.AI	About Algorithm for Transformation of Logic Functions ( ATLF )	In this article the algorithm for transformation of logic functions which are given by truth tables is considered . The suggested algorithm allows the transformation of many-valued logic functions with the required number of variables and can be looked in this sense as universal .
