This structure from motion inequality relates space dimension , camera parameter dimension , the number of cameras and number points and global symmetry properties and provides a rigorous criterion for which reconstruction is not possible with probability 1 . Mathematically the inequality is based on Frobenius theorem which is a geometric incarnation of the fundamental theorem of linear algebra . The paper also provides a general mathematical formalism for the structure from motion problem . It includes the situation the points can move while the camera takes the pictures .
0708.2462	cs.IT math.IT	Eigenvalue bounds on the pseudocodeword weight of expander codes	Four different ways of obtaining low-density parity-check codes from expander graphs are considered . For each case , lower bounds on the minimum stopping set size and the minimum pseudocodeword weight of expander ( LDPC ) codes are derived . These bounds are compared with the known eigenvalue-based lower bounds on the minimum distance of expander codes . Furthermore , Tanner's parity-oriented eigenvalue lower bound on the minimum distance is generalized to yield a new lower bound on the minimum pseudocodeword weight . These bounds are useful in predicting the performance of LDPC codes under graph-based iterative decoding and linear programming decoding .

If moreover each vertex $ u \in V ( G ) $ is associated with costs $ c_i ( u ) , i \in V ( H ) $ , then the cost of a homomorphism $ f $ is $ \sum_ { u\in V ( G ) } c_ { f ( u ) } ( u ) $ . For each fixed digraph $ H $ , the { \em minimum cost homomorphism problem } for $ H $ , denoted MinHOM ( $ H $ ) , is the following problem . Given an input digraph $ G $ , together with costs $ c_i ( u ) $ , $ u\in V ( G ) $ , $ i\in V ( H ) $ , and an integer $ k $ , decide if $ G $ admits a homomorphism to $ H $ of cost not exceeding $ k $ . We focus on the minimum cost homomorphism problem for { \em reflexive } digraphs $ H $ ( every vertex of $ H $ has a loop ) . It is known that the problem MinHOM ( $ H $ ) is polynomial time solvable if the digraph $ H $ has a { \em Min-Max ordering } , i.e. , if its vertices can be linearly ordered by $ < $ so that $ i < j , s < r $ and $ ir , js \in A ( H ) $ imply that $ is \in A ( H ) $ and $ jr \in A ( H ) $ . We give a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of reflexive digraphs with a Min-Max ordering ; our characterization implies a polynomial time test for the existence of a Min-Max ordering . Using this characterization , we show that for a reflexive digraph $ H $ which does not admit a Min-Max ordering , the minimum cost homomorphism problem is NP-complete . Thus we obtain a full dichotomy classification of the complexity of minimum cost homomorphism problems for reflexive digraphs .
