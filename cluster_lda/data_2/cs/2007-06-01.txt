That sort of reduction permits unlimited reusage of the computational resource represented by the antecedent . An at least equally basic and natural sort of algorithmic reduction , however , is the one that does not allow such reusage . The present article shows that turning the logic of the first sort of reduction into the logic of the second sort of reduction takes nothing more than just deleting the contraction rule from its Gentzen-style axiomatization . The first ( Turing ) sort of interactive reduction is also shown to come in three natural versions . While those three versions are very different from each other , their logical behaviors ( in isolation ) turn out to be indistinguishable , with that common behavior being precisely captured by implicative intuitionistic logic . Among the other contributions of the present article is an informal introduction of a series of new -- finite and bounded -- versions of recurrence operations and the associated reduction operations .

0706.0225	cs.IT math.IT	On the End-to-End Distortion for a Buffered Transmission over Fading Channel	In this paper , we study the end-to-end distortion/delay tradeoff for a analogue source transmitted over a fading channel . The analogue source is quantized and stored in a buffer until it is transmitted . There are two extreme cases as far as buffer delay is concerned : no delay and infinite delay . We observe that there is a significant power gain by introducing a buffer delay . Our goal is to investigate the situation between these two extremes . Using recently proposed \emph { effective capacity } concept , we derive a closed-form formula for this tradeoff . For SISO case , an asymptotically tight upper bound for our distortion-delay curve is derived , which approaches to the infinite delay lower bound as $ \mathcal { D } _\infty \exp ( \frac { C } { \tau_n } ) $ , with $ \tau_n $ is the normalized delay , $ C $ is a constant . For more general MIMO channel , we computed the distortion SNR exponent -- the exponential decay rate of the expected distortion in the high SNR regime . Numerical results demonstrate that introduction of a small amount delay can save significant transmission power .
