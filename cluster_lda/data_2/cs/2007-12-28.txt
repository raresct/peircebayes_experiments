0712.4318	cs.AI	Convergence of Expected Utilities with Algorithmic Probability Distributions	We consider an agent interacting with an unknown environment . The environment is a function which maps natural numbers to natural numbers ; the agent 's set of hypotheses about the environment contains all such functions which are computable and compatible with a finite set of known input-output pairs , and the agent assigns a positive probability to each such hypothesis . We do not require that this probability distribution be computable , but it must be bounded below by a positive computable function . The agent has a utility function on outputs from the environment . We show that if this utility function is bounded below in absolute value by an unbounded computable function , then the expected utility of any input is undefined . This implies that a computable utility function will have convergent expected utilities iff that function is bounded .

Based on these equivalences , we study the algebraic operations on orthomodular lattice-valued regular languages , then we establish Kleene theorem in the frame of quantum logic .
