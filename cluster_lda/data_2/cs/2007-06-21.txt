We focus on the double limit of small defect probability , p < < 1 , and large number of variables , N > > 1 , taking either p- > 0 after $ N\to\infty $ or $ p=1/N^ { \beta } $ with $ \beta\in ( 0,1/2 ) $ . In both settings the optimal number of tests which are required to identify with certainty the defectives via a two-stage procedure , $ \bar T ( N , p ) $ , is known to scale as $ Np|\log p| $ . Here we determine the sharp asymptotic value of $ \bar T ( N , p ) / ( Np|\log p| ) $ and construct a class of two-stage algorithms over which this optimal value is attained . This is done by choosing a proper bipartite regular graph ( of tests and variable nodes ) for the first stage of the detection . Furthermore we prove that this optimal value is also attained on average over a random bipartite graph where all variables have the same degree , while the tests have Poisson-distributed degrees . Finally , we improve the existing upper and lower bound for the optimal number of tests in the case $ p=1/N^ { \beta } $ with $ \beta\in [ 1/2,1 ) $ .

In densely populated urban areas WiFi routers form a tightly interconnected proximity network that can be exploited as a substrate for the spreading of malware able to launch massive fraudulent attack and affect entire urban areas WiFi networks . In this paper we consider several scenarios for the deployment of malware that spreads solely over the wireless channel of major urban areas in the US . We develop an epidemiological model that takes into consideration prevalent security flaws on these routers . The spread of such a contagion is simulated on real-world data for geo-referenced wireless routers . We uncover a major weakness of WiFi networks in that most of the simulated scenarios show tens of thousands of routers infected in as little time as two weeks , with the majority of the infections occurring in the first 24 to 48 hours . We indicate possible containment and prevention measure to limit the eventual harm of such an attack .
0706.3159	cs.PL cs.SE	Une s\'emantique observationnelle du mod\`ele des bo\^ites pour la r\'esolution de programmes logiques ( version \'etendue )	This report specifies an observational semantics and gives an original presentation of the Byrd 's box model . The approach accounts for the semantics of Prolog tracers independently of a particular implementation . Traces are , in general , considered as rather obscure and difficult to use . The proposed formal presentation of a trace constitutes a simple and pedagogical approach for teaching Prolog or for implementing Prolog tracers . It constitutes a form of declarative specification for the tracers . Our approach highlights qualities of the box model which made its success , but also its drawbacks and limits . As a matter of fact , the presented semantics is only one example to illustrate general problems relating to tracers and observing processes . Observing processes know , from observed processes , only their traces . The issue is then to be able to reconstitute by the sole analysis of the trace the main part of the observed process , and if possible , without any loss of information .
0706.3165	cs.HC	A solution for actors ' viewpoints representation with collaborative product development	As product complexity and marketing competition increase , a collaborative product development is necessary for companies which develop high quality products in short lead-times . To support product actors from different fields , disciplines , and locations , wishing to exchange and share information , the representation of the actors ' viewpoints is the underlying requirement of the collaborative product development . The actors ' viewpoints approach was designed to provide an organisational framework following the actors ' perspectives in the collaboration , and their relationships , could be explicitly gathered and formatted . The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple integration of product information as different views , promotes gathering of actors' interests , and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration . In this paper , a solution for neutral viewpoints representation is proposed . The product , process , and organisation information models are seriatim discussed . A series of issues referring to the viewpoints representation are discussed in detail . Based on XML standard , taking cyclone vessel as an example , an application case of part of product information modelling is stated .
0706.3170	cs.IT math.IT	Asymptotic Analysis of General Multiuser Detectors in MIMO DS-CDMA Channels	We analyze a MIMO DS-CDMA channel with a general multiuser detector including a nonlinear multiuser detector , using the replica method . In the many-user , limit the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the multiuser detector is decoupled into a bank of single-user SIMO Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is employed . On the other hand , it is decoupled into a bank of single-user MIMO Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is not employed . The spectral efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the spatial spreading scheme is comparable with that of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel using an optimal space-time block code without the spatial spreading scheme . In the case of the QPSK data modulation scheme the spectral efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the MMSE detector shows { \it waterfall } behavior and is very close to the corresponding sum capacity when the system load is just below the transition point of the { \it waterfall } behavior . Our result implies that the performance of a multiuser detector taking the data modulation scheme into consideration can be far superior to that of linear multiuser detectors .
0706.3188	cs.LG stat.ML	A tutorial on conformal prediction	Conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of confidence in new predictions . Given an error probability $ \epsilon $ , together with a method that makes a prediction $ \hat { y } $ of a label $ y $ , it produces a set of labels , typically containing $ \hat { y } $ , that also contains $ y $ with probability $ 1-\epsilon $ . Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing $ \hat { y } $ : a nearest-neighbor method , a support-vector machine , ridge regression , etc . Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively , each one being revealed before the next is predicted . The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution , then the successive predictions will be right $ 1-\epsilon $ of the time , even though they are based on an accumulating dataset rather than on independent datasets . In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently , other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction . The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these . This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples . A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is provided in `` Algorithmic Learning in a Random World '' , by Vladimir Vovk , Alex Gammerman , and Glenn Shafer ( Springer , 2005 ) .
