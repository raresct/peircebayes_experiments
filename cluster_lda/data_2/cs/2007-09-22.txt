0709.3586	cs.NE cs.LG	Une adaptation des cartes auto-organisatrices pour des donn\'ees d\'ecrites par un tableau de dissimilarit\'es	Many data analysis methods can not be applied to data that are not represented by a fixed number of real values , whereas most of real world observations are not readily available in such a format . Vector based data analysis methods have therefore to be adapted in order to be used with non standard complex data . A flexible and general solution for this adaptation is to use a ( dis ) similarity measure . Indeed , thanks to expert knowledge on the studied data , it is generally possible to define a measure that can be used to make pairwise comparison between observations . General data analysis methods are then obtained by adapting existing methods to ( dis ) similarity matrices . In this article , we propose an adaptation of Kohonen 's Self Organizing Map ( SOM ) to ( dis ) similarity data . The proposed algorithm is an adapted version of the vector based batch SOM . The method is validated on real world data : we provide an analysis of the usage patterns of the web site of the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique , constructed thanks to web log mining method .
0709.3587	cs.NE cs.LG	Self-organizing maps and symbolic data	In data analysis new forms of complex data have to be considered like for example ( symbolic data , functional data , web data , trees , SQL query and multimedia data , ... ) . In this context classical data analysis for knowledge discovery based on calculating the center of gravity can not be used because input are not $ \mathbb { R } ^p $ vectors . In this paper , we present an application on real world symbolic data using the self-organizing map . To this end , we propose an extension of the self-organizing map that can handle symbolic data .
