0711.0114	cs.CG	Geometric Spanners With Small Chromatic Number	Given an integer $ k \geq 2 $ , we consider the problem of computing the smallest real number $ t ( k ) $ such that for each set $ P $ of points in the plane , there exists a $ t ( k ) $ -spanner for $ P $ that has chromatic number at most $ k $ . We prove that $ t ( 2 ) = 3 $ , $ t ( 3 ) = 2 $ , $ t ( 4 ) = \sqrt { 2 } $ , and give upper and lower bounds on $ t ( k ) $ for $ k > 4 $ . We also show that for any $ \epsilon > 0 $ , there exists a $ ( 1+\epsilon ) t ( k ) $ -spanner for $ P $ that has $ O ( |P| ) $ edges and chromatic number at most $ k $ . Finally , we consider an on-line variant of the problem where the points of $ P $ are given one after another , and the color of a point must be assigned at the moment the point is given . In this setting , we prove that $ t ( 2 ) = 3 $ , $ t ( 3 ) = 1+ \sqrt { 3 } $ , $ t ( 4 ) = 1+ \sqrt { 2 } $ , and give upper and lower bounds on $ t ( k ) $ for $ k > 4 $ .
0711.0128	cs.CR	Security Analysis of a Remote User Authentication Scheme with Smart Cards	Yoon et al . proposed a new efficient remote user authentication scheme using smart cards to solve the security problems of W. C. Ku and S. M. Chen scheme . This paper reviews Yoon et al . scheme and then proves that the password change phase of Yoon et al . scheme is still insecure . This paper also proves that the Yoon et al . is still vulnerable to parallel session attack .
0711.0189	cs.DS cs.LG	A Tutorial on Spectral Clustering	In recent years , spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms . It is simple to implement , can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software , and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm . On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious , and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does . The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions . We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties , present the most common spectral clustering algorithms , and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches . Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed .
0711.0194	cs.LO	Coinductive Proof Principles for Stochastic Processes	We give an explicit coinduction principle for recursively-defined stochastic processes . The principle applies to any closed property , not just equality , and works even when solutions are not unique . The rule encapsulates low-level analytic arguments , allowing reasoning about such processes at a higher algebraic level . We illustrate the use of the rule in deriving properties of a simple coin-flip process .
0711.0237	cs.IT math.IT	Zero-rate feedback can achieve the empirical capacity	The utility of limited feedback for coding over an individual sequence of DMCs is investigated . This study complements recent results showing how limited or noisy feedback can boost the reliability of communication . A strategy with fixed input distribution $ P $ is given that asymptotically achieves rates arbitrarily close to the mutual information induced by $ P $ and the state-averaged channel . When the capacity achieving input distribution is the same over all channel states , this achieves rates at least as large as the capacity of the state averaged channel , sometimes called the empirical capacity .
