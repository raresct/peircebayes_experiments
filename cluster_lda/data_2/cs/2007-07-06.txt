Transmission by the primary user must be detected reliably even in the low signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) regime and in the face of shadowing and fading . Communication signals are typically cyclostationary , and have many periodic statistical properties related to the symbol rate , the coding and modulation schemes as well as the guard periods , for example . These properties can be exploited in designing a detector , and for distinguishing between the primary and secondary users ' signals . In this paper , a generalized likelihood ratio test ( GLRT ) for detecting the presence of cyclostationarity using multiple cyclic frequencies is proposed . Distributed decision making is employed by combining the quantized local test statistics from many secondary users . User cooperation allows for mitigating the effects of shadowing and provides a larger footprint for the cognitive radio system . Simulation examples demonstrate the resulting performance gains in the low SNR regime and the benefits of cooperative detection .
0707.0926	cs.LO cs.PL	Theorem proving support in programming language semantics	We describe several views of the semantics of a simple programming language as formal documents in the calculus of inductive constructions that can be verified by the Coq proof system . Covered aspects are natural semantics , denotational semantics , axiomatic semantics , and abstract interpretation . Descriptions as recursive functions are also provided whenever suitable , thus yielding a a verification condition generator and a static analyser that can be run inside the theorem prover for use in reflective proofs . Extraction of an interpreter from the denotational semantics is also described . All different aspects are formally proved sound with respect to the natural semantics specification .
0707.0969	cs.IT math.IT	Resource Allocation for Wireless Fading Relay Channels : Max-Min Solution	As a basic information-theoretic model for fading relay channels , the parallel relay channel is first studied , for which lower and upper bounds on the capacity are derived . For the parallel relay channel with degraded subchannels , the capacity is established , and is further demonstrated via the Gaussian case , for which the synchronized and asynchronized capacities are obtained . The capacity achieving power allocation at the source and relay nodes among the subchannels is characterized . The fading relay channel is then studied , for which resource allocations that maximize the achievable rates are obtained for both the full-duplex and half-duplex cases . Capacities are established for fading relay channels that satisfy certain conditions .
0707.0978	cs.IT math.IT	When Network Coding and Dirty Paper Coding meet in a Cooperative Ad Hoc Network	We develop and analyze new cooperative strategies for ad hoc networks that are more spectrally efficient than classical DF cooperative protocols . Using analog network coding , our strategies preserve the practical half-duplex assumption but relax the orthogonality constraint . The introduction of interference due to non-orthogonality is mitigated thanks to precoding , in particular Dirty Paper coding . Combined with smart power allocation , our cooperation strategies allow to save time and lead to more efficient use of bandwidth and to improved network throughput with respect to classical RDF/PDF .
0707.1008	cs.IT math.IT	On Cognitive Interference Networks	We study the high-power asymptotic behavior of the sum-rate capacity of multi-user interference networks with an equal number of transmitters and receivers . We assume that each transmitter is cognizant of the message it wishes to convey to its corresponding receiver and also of the messages that a subset of the other transmitters wish to send . The receivers are assumed not to be able to cooperate in any way so that they must base their decision on the signal they receive only . We focus on the network 's pre-log , which is defined as the limiting ratio of the sum-rate capacity to half the logarithm of the transmitted power . We present both upper and lower bounds on the network's pre-log . The lower bounds are based on a linear partial-cancellation scheme which entails linearly transforming Gaussian codebooks so as to eliminate the interference in a subset of the receivers . Inter alias , the bounds give a complete characterization of the networks and side-information settings that result in a full pre-log , i.e. , in a pre-log that is equal to the number of transmitters ( and receivers ) as well as a complete characterization of networks whose pre-log is equal to the full pre-log minus one . They also fully characterize networks where the full pre-log can only be achieved if each transmitter knows the messages of all users , i.e. , when the side-information is '' full '' .

0707.1051	cs.DS	Noisy Sorting Without Resampling	In this paper we study noisy sorting without re-sampling . In this problem there is an unknown order $ a_ { \pi ( 1 ) } < ... < a_ { \pi ( n ) } $ where $ \pi $ is a permutation on $ n $ elements . The input is the status of $ n \choose 2 $ queries of the form $ q ( a_i , x_j ) $ , where $ q ( a_i , a_j ) = + $ with probability at least $ 1/2+\ga $ if $ \pi ( i ) > \pi ( j ) $ for all pairs $ i \neq j $ , where $ \ga > 0 $ is a constant and $ q ( a_i , a_j ) = -q ( a_j , a_i ) $ for all $ i $ and $ j $ . It is assumed that the errors are independent . Given the status of the queries the goal is to find the maximum likelihood order . In other words , the goal is find a permutation $ \sigma $ that minimizes the number of pairs $ \sigma ( i ) > \sigma ( j ) $ where $ q ( \sigma ( i ) , \sigma ( j ) ) = - $ . The problem so defined is the feedback arc set problem on distributions of inputs , each of which is a tournament obtained as a noisy perturbations of a linear order . Note that when $ \ga < 1/2 $ and $ n $ is large , it is impossible to recover the original order $ \pi $ . It is known that the weighted feedback are set problem on tournaments is NP-hard in general . Here we present an algorithm of running time $ n^ { O ( \gamma^ { -4 } ) } $ and sampling complexity $ O_ { \gamma } ( n \log n ) $ that with high probability solves the noisy sorting without re-sampling problem . We also show that if $ a_ { \sigma ( 1 ) } , a_ { \sigma ( 2 ) } , ... , a_ { \sigma ( n ) } $ is an optimal solution of the problem then it is `` close '' to the original order . More formally , with high probability it holds that $ \sum_i |\sigma ( i ) - \pi ( i ) | = \Theta ( n ) $ and $ \max_i |\sigma ( i ) - \pi ( i ) | = \Theta ( \log n ) $ . Our results are of interest in applications to ranking , such as ranking in sports , or ranking of search items based on comparisons by experts .
0707.1053	cs.GT	Exploration via design and the cost of uncertainty in keyword auctions	We present a deterministic exploration mechanism for sponsored search auctions , which enables the auctioneer to learn the relevance scores of advertisers , and allows advertisers to estimate the true value of clicks generated at the auction site . This exploratory mechanism deviates only minimally from the mechanism being currently used by Google and Yahoo ! in the sense that it retains the same pricing rule , similar ranking scheme , as well as , similar mathematical structure of payoffs . In particular , the estimations of the relevance scores and true-values are achieved by providing a chance to lower ranked advertisers to obtain better slots . This allows the search engine to potentially test a new pool of advertisers , and correspondingly , enables new advertisers to estimate the value of clicks/leads generated via the auction . Both these quantities are unknown a priori , and their knowledge is necessary for the auction to operate efficiently . We show that such an exploration policy can be incorporated without any significant loss in revenue for the auctioneer . We compare the revenue of the new mechanism to that of the standard mechanism at their corresponding symmetric Nash equilibria and compute the cost of uncertainty , which is defined as the relative loss in expected revenue per impression . We also bound the loss in efficiency , as well as , in user experience due to exploration , under the same solution concept ( i.e . SNE ) . Thus the proposed exploration mechanism learns the relevance scores while incorporating the incentive constraints from the advertisers who are selfish and are trying to maximize their own profits , and therefore , the exploration is essentially achieved via mechanism design . We also discuss variations of the new mechanism such as truthful implementations .
0707.1057	cs.GT	For-profit mediators in sponsored search advertising	A mediator is a well-known construct in game theory , and is an entity that plays on behalf of some of the agents who choose to use its services , while the rest of the agents participate in the game directly . We initiate a game theoretic study of sponsored search auctions , such as those used by Google and Yahoo ! , involving { \em incentive driven } mediators . We refer to such mediators as { \em for-profit } mediators , so as to distinguish them from mediators introduced in prior work , who have no monetary incentives , and are driven by the altruistic goal of implementing certain desired outcomes . We show that in our model , ( i ) players/advertisers can improve their payoffs by choosing to use the services of the mediator , compared to directly participating in the auction ; ( ii ) the mediator can obtain monetary benefit by managing the advertising burden of its group of advertisers ; and ( iii ) the payoffs of the mediator and the advertisers it plays for are compatible with the incentive constraints from the advertisers who do dot use its services . A simple intuition behind the above result comes from the observation that the mediator has more information about and more control over the bid profile than any individual advertiser , allowing her to reduce the payments made to the auctioneer , while still maintaining incentive constraints . Further , our results indicate that there are significant opportunities for diversification in the internet economy and we should expect it to continue to develop richer structure , with room for different types of agents to coexist .
0707.1059	cs.PL	Projection semantics for rigid loops	A rigid loop is a for-loop with a counter not accessible to the loop body or any other part of a program . Special instructions for rigid loops are introduced on top of the syntax of the program algebra PGA . Two different semantic projections are provided and proven equivalent . One of these is taken to have definitional status on the basis of two criteria : `normative semantic adequacy ' and `indicative algorithmic adequacy ' .
