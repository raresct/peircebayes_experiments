A simple and easily accessible correctness proof is given which shows that this algorithm achieves a relative error-correction radius of $ \tau \leq ( 1 - \sqrt { { \ell q^ { m-1 } } / { n } } ) $ . This is an improvement over the proof using one-point Algebraic-Geometric codes given in \cite { PW2005 } . The described algorithm can be adapted to decode Product-Reed-Solomon codes . We then propose a new low complexity recursive algebraic decoding algorithm for Reed-Muller and Product-Reed-Solomon codes . Our algorithm achieves a relative error correction radius of $ \tau \leq \prod_ { i=1 } ^m ( 1 - \sqrt { k_i/q } ) $ . This technique is then proved to outperform the Pellikaan-Wu method in both complexity and error correction radius over a wide range of code rates .
0704.2841	cs.IT math.IT	A High-Throughput Cross-Layer Scheme for Distributed Wireless Ad Hoc Networks	In wireless ad hoc networks , distributed nodes can collaboratively form an antenna array for long-distance communications to achieve high energy efficiency . In recent work , Ochiai , et al. , have shown that such collaborative beamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main lobe and low sidelobes . However , the process of collaboration introduces significant delay , since all collaborating nodes need access to the same information . In this paper , a technique that significantly reduces the collaboration overhead is proposed . It consists of two phases . In the first phase , nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion . Collisions , when they occur , are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets . In the second phase , a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations . This step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex number , which is independently computed by each cooperating node , and which enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination . The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network coordinates . The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput , which in certain cases exceeds one .

In recent years , the Networks-on-Chip ( NoC ) paradigm emerged as a promising solution to interconnect challenges in silicon-based electronics . Current NoC architectures are either highly regular or fully customized , both of which represent implausible assumptions for emerging bottom-up self-assembled molecular electronics that are generally assumed to have a high degree of irregularity and imperfection . Here , we pragmatically and experimentally investigate important design trade-offs and properties of an irregular , abstract , yet physically plausible 3D small-world interconnect fabric that is inspired by modern network-on-chip paradigms . We vary the framework 's key parameters , such as the connectivity , the number of switch nodes , the distribution of long- versus short-range connections , and measure the network 's relevant communication characteristics . We further explore the robustness against link failures and the ability and efficiency to solve a simple toy problem , the synchronization task . The results confirm that ( 1 ) computation in irregular assemblies is a promising and disruptive computing paradigm for self-assembled nano-scale electronics and ( 2 ) that 3D small-world interconnect fabrics with a power-law decaying distribution of shortcut lengths are physically plausible and have major advantages over local 2D and 3D regular topologies .

They provide an introduction to the basic concepts in modern ( probabilistic ) coding theory , highlighting connections with statistical mechanics . We also stress common concepts with other disciplines dealing with similar problems that can be generically referred to as `large graphical models ' . While most of the lectures are devoted to the classical channel coding problem over simple memoryless channels , we present a discussion of more complex channel models . We conclude with an overview of the main open challenges in the field .
