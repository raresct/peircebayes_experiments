0708.0200	cs.LO	A Note on Shortest Developments	De Vrijer has presented a proof of the finite developments theorem which , in addition to showing that all developments are finite , gives an effective reduction strategy computing longest developments as well as a simple formula computing their length . We show that by applying a rather simple and intuitive principle of duality to de Vrijer 's approach one arrives at a proof that some developments are finite which in addition yields an effective reduction strategy computing shortest developments as well as a simple formula computing their length . The duality fails for general beta-reduction . Our results simplify previous work by Khasidashvili .

Local Kalman filters are implemented on the ( $ n_l- $ dimensional , where $ n_l\ll n $ ) sub-systems that are obtained after spatially decomposing the large-scale system . The resulting sub-systems overlap , which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman filters , preserve an $ L $ th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized error processes . The information loss due to the $ L $ th order Gauss-Markovian approximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that decreases as $ L\uparrow $ . The order of the approximation , $ L $ , leads to a lower bound on the dimension of the sub-systems , hence , providing a criterion for sub-system selection . The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local error covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion ( DICI ) algorithm that we introduce . The DICI algorithm computes the ( approximated ) centralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local communication and low-order computation . We fuse the observations that are common among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and consensus averaging algorithms . The proposed algorithm achieves full distribution of the Kalman filter that is coherent with the centralized Kalman filter with an $ L $ th order Gaussian-Markovian structure on the centralized error processes . Nowhere storage , communication , or computation of $ n- $ dimensional vectors and matrices is needed ; only $ n_l \ll n $ dimensional vectors and matrices are communicated or used in the computation at the sensors .
