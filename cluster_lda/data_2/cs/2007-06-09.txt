Lots of models have been proposed in the litterature for representing such temporal information . All derive from a point-based or an interval-based framework . One fundamental reasoning task that arises in applications of these frameworks is given by the following scheme : given possibly indefinite and incomplete knowledge of the binary relationships between some temporal objects , find the consistent scenarii between all these objects . All these models require transitive tables -- or similarly inference rules -- for solving such tasks . We have defined an alternative model , S-languages - to represent qualitative temporal information , based on the only two relations of \emph { precedence } and \emph { simultaneity } . In this paper , we show how this model enables to avoid transitive tables or inference rules to handle this kind of problem .

The algorithm is easily fast enough to use on the fly for typical problem sizes , or as a subroutine in an overall optimization .
