0710.4235	q-bio.OT	Top-Down Causation by Information Control : From a Philosophical Problem to a Scientific Research Program	It has been claimed that different types of causes must be considered in biological systems , including top-down as well as same-level and bottom-up causation , thus enabling the top levels to be causally efficacious in their own right . To clarify this issue , important distinctions between information and signs are introduced here and the concepts of information control and functional equivalence classes in those systems are rigorously defined and used to characterise when top down causation by feedback control happens , in a way that is testable . The causally significant elements we consider are equivalence classes of lower level processes , realised in biological systems through different operations having the same outcome within the context of information control and networks .
0710.4269	q-bio.MN	Shape , size and robustness : feasible regions in the parameter space of biochemical networks	The concept of robustness of regulatory networks has been closely related to the nature of the interactions among genes , and the capability of pattern maintenance or reproducibility . Defining this robustness property is a challenging task , but mathematical models have often associated it to the volume of the space of admissible parameters . Not only the volume of the space but also its topology and geometry contain information on essential aspects of the network , including feasible pathways , switching between two parallel pathways or distinct/disconnected active regions of parameters . A general method is presented here to characterize the space of admissible parameters , by writing it as a semi-algebraic set , and then theoretically analyzing its topology and geometry , as well as volume . This method provides a more objective and complete measure of the robustness of a developmental module . As an illustration , the segment polarity gene network is analyzed .
