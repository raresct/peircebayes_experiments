0708.3825	q-bio.PE	Stochastic Fluctuations in Epidemics on Networks	The effects of demographic stochasticity in the long term behaviour of endemic infectious diseases have been considered for long as a necessary addition to an underlying deterministic theory . The latter would explain the regular behaviour of recurrent epidemics , and the former the superimposed noise of observed incidence patterns . Recently , a stochastic theory based on a mechanism of resonance with internal noise has shifted the role of stochasticity closer to the center stage , by showing that the major dynamic patterns found in the incidence data can be explained as resonant fluctuations , whose behaviour is largely independent of the amplitude of seasonal forcing , and by contrast very sensitive to the basic epidemiological parameters . Here we elaborate on that approach , by adding an ingredient which is missing in standard epidemic models , the 'mixing network ' through which infection may propagate . We find that spatial correlations have a major effect in the enhancement of the amplitude and the coherence of the resonant stochastic fluctuations , providing the ordered patterns of recurrent epidemics , whose period may differ significantly from that of the small oscillations around the deterministic equilibrium . We also show that the inclusion of a more realistic , time correlated , recovery profile instead of exponentially distributed infectious periods may , even in the random-mixing limit , contribute to the same effect .

The proof employs the Leray-Schauder degree , applied to an appropriately constructed homotopy .
