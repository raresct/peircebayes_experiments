0708.2294	q-bio.CB q-bio.BM	A probabilistic regulatory network for the human immune system	In this paper we made a review of some papers about probabilistic regulatory networks ( PRN ) , in particular we introduce our concept of homomorphisms of PRN with an example of projection of a regulatory network to a smaller one . We apply the model PRN ( or Probabilistic Boolean Network ) to the immune system , the PRN works with two functions . The model called `` '' The B/T-cells interaction '' '' is Boolean , so we are really working with a Probabilistic Boolean Network . Using Markov Chains we determine the state of equilibrium of the immune response .
0708.2421	q-bio.MN q-bio.BM	Propagation of large concentration changes in reversible protein binding networks	We study how the dynamic equilibrium of the reversible protein-protein binding network in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to large changes in abundances of individual proteins . The magnitude of shifts between free and bound concentrations of their immediate and more distant neighbors in the network is influenced by such factors as the network topology , the distribution of protein concentrations among its nodes , and the average binding strength . Our primary conclusion is that , on average , the effects of a perturbation are strongly localized and exponentially decay with the network distance away from the perturbed node , which explains why , despite globally connected topology , individual functional modules in such networks are able to operate fairly independently . We also found that under specific favorable conditions , realized in a significant number of paths in the yeast network , concentration perturbations can selectively propagate over considerable network distances ( up to four steps ) . Such `` action-at-a-distance '' requires high concentrations of heterodimers along the path as well as low free ( unbound ) concentration of intermediate proteins .
