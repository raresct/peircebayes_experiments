While it inhibits cell proliferation , it also increases cell motility and decreases cell -- cell adhesion . Coupling mathematical modeling and experiments , we investigate the growth and motility of oncogene -- expressing human mammary epithelial cells under exposure to TGF -- $ \beta $ . We use a version of the well -- known Fisher -- Kolmogorov equation , and prescribe a procedure for its parametrization . We quantify the simultaneous effects of TGF -- $ \beta $ to increase the tendency of individual cells and cell clusters to move randomly and to decrease overall population growth . We demonstrate that in experiments with TGF -- $ \beta $ treated cells \textit { in vitro } , TGF -- $ \beta $ increases cell motility by a factor of 2 and decreases cell proliferation by a factor of 1/2 in comparison with untreated cells .
