0704.3808	q-bio.PE q-bio.OT	On Gene Duplication Models for Evolving Regulatory Networks	Background : Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular networks . Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving force in shaping the topology of molecular networks . In particular it has been noted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential attachment , and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of molecular networks . Results : We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by including directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of unidirectional growth . We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to quantify potential links during duplication and rewiring . We find that this in itself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites in procaryotes . The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree distribution , p ( k ) & prop ; 1/k^ & gamma ; , with exponent & gamma ; =1 in the non-growing case , and with & gamma ; > 1 when the network is growing . Conclusions : We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial recombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic regulatory networks . Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad to be consistent with data , thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a main additional constraint on duplicated genes . Our analysis shows that gene duplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree distributions , if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream regions of genes .
