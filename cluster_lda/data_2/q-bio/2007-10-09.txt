0710.1889	q-bio.GN	Understanding Transcriptional Regulation Using De-novo Sequence Motif Discovery , Network Inference and Interactome Data	Gene regulation is a complex process involving the role of several genomic elements which work in concert to drive spatio-temporal expression . The experimental characterization of gene regulatory elements is a very complex and resource-intensive process . One of the major goals in computational biology is the \textit { in-silico } annotation of previously uncharacterized elements using results from the subset of known , previously annotated , regulatory elements . The recent results of the ENCODE project ( \emph { http : //encode.nih.gov } ) presented in-depth analysis of such functional ( regulatory ) non-coding elements for 1 % of the human genome . It is hoped that the results obtained on this subset can be scaled to the rest of the genome . This is an extremely important effort which will enable faster dissection of other functional elements in key biological processes such as disease progression and organ development ( \cite { Kleinjan2005 } , \cite { Lieb2006 } . The computational annotation of these hitherto uncharacterized regions would require an identification of features that have good predictive value . In this work , we study transcriptional regulation as a problem in heterogeneous data integration , across sequence , expression and interactome level attributes . Using the example of the \textit { Gata2 } gene and its recently discovered urogenital enhancers \cite { Khandekar2004 } as a case study , we examine the predictive value of various high throughput functional genomic assays ( from projects like ENCODE and SymAtlas ) in characterizing these enhancers and their regulatory role . Observing results from the application of modern statistical learning methodologies for each of these data modalities , we propose a set of features that are most discriminatory to find these enhancers .
