Functionally similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and capacity to evolve new functions , but it has remained unclear whether any of these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties . RESULTS : Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently large . We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes , and show that proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards higher mutational robustness . Proteins from the larger population also evolve greater stability , a biophysical property that is known to enhance both mutational robustness and evolvability . The excess mutational robustness and stability is well described by existing mathematical theories , and can be quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral network . CONCLUSIONS : Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in highly polymorphic populations . We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that exist in large populations .
