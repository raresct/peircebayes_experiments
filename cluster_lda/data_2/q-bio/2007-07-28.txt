0707.4244	q-bio.CB q-bio.QM	Distinguishing cancerous from non-cancerous cells through analysis of electrical noise	Since 1984 , electric cell-substrate impedance sensing ( ECIS ) has been used to monitor cell behavior in tissue culture and has proven sensitive to cell morphological changes and cell motility . We have taken ECIS measurements on several cultures of non-cancerous ( HOSE ) and cancerous ( SKOV ) human ovarian surface epithelial cells . By analyzing the noise in real and imaginary electrical impedance , we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish the two cell types purely from signatures of their electrical noise . Our measures include power-spectral exponents , Hurst and detrended fluctuation analysis , and estimates of correlation time ; principal-component analysis combines all the measures . The noise from both cancerous and non-cancerous cultures shows correlations on many time scales , but these correlations are stronger for the non-cancerous cells .
