0706.3735	q-bio.MN	Multi-bit information storage by multisite phosphorylation	Cells store information in DNA and in stable programs of gene expression , which thereby implement forms of long-term cellular memory . Cells must also possess short-term forms of information storage , implemented post-translationally , to transduce and interpret external signals . CaMKII , for instance , is thought to implement a one-bit ( bistable ) short-term memory required for learning at post-synaptic densities . Here we show by mathematical analysis that multisite protein phosphorylation , which is ubiquitous in all eukaryotic signalling pathways , exhibits multistability for which the maximal number of steady states increases with the number of sites . If there are n sites , the maximal information storage capacity is at least log_2 ( n+2 ) /2 bits when n is even and log_2 ( n+1 ) /2 bits when n is odd . Furthermore , when substrate is in excess , enzyme saturation together with an alternating low/high pattern in the site-specific relative catalytic efficiencies , enriches for multistability . That is , within physiologically plausible ranges for parameters , multistability becomes more likely than monostability . We discuss the experimental challenges in pursuing these predictions and in determining the biological role of short-term information storage .

The potential energies and vibrational free energies of inherent structures are highly correlated , and both reflect simple measures of networks of native contacts . These connections have important consequences for models of protein dynamics and thermodynamics .
