0709.3602	q-bio.QM q-bio.SC	Time and length scales of autocrine signals in three dimensions	A model of autocrine signaling in cultures of suspended cells is developed on the basis of the effective medium approximation . The fraction of autocrine ligands , the mean and distribution of distances traveled by paracrine ligands before binding , as well as the mean and distribution of the ligand lifetime are derived . Interferon signaling by dendritic immune cells is considered as an illustration .
0709.3606	q-bio.MN cond-mat.stat-mech	Noise enhanced persistence in a biochemical regulatory network with feedback control	We find that discrete noise of inhibiting ( signal ) molecules can greatly delay the extinction of plasmids in a plasmid replication system : a prototypical biochemical regulatory network . We calculate the probability distribution of the metastable state of the plasmids and show on this example that the reaction rate equations may fail in predicting the average number of regulated molecules even when this number is large , and the time is much shorter than the mean extinction time .
