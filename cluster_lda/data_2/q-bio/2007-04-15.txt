0704.1908	q-bio.SC physics.ed-ph q-bio.QM	A practical guide to stochastic simulations of reaction-diffusion processes	A practical introduction to stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion processes is presented . No prior knowledge of stochastic simulations is assumed . The methods are explained using illustrative examples . The article starts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of chemical reactions . Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular diffusion are given . Finally , basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are presented . The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic models are explained and basic mathematical tools ( e.g . chemical master equation ) are presented . The article concludes with an overview of more advanced methods and problems .

We statistically test this data for consistency with rates extrapolated from information on bone cancer in modern vertebrates , and find that there is no evidence of a different rate . Thus , this test provides no support for a possible role of ionizing radiation in the K-T extinction event .
