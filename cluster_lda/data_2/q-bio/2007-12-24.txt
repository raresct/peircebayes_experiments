0712.4001	q-bio.TO	A ptototype compartmental model of blood pressure distribution	We consider a system of differential equations the behavior of which solutions possesses several properties characteristic of the blood pressure distribution . The system can be used for a compartmental modeling of the cardiovascular system . It admits a unique bounded solution such that all coordinates of the solution are separated from zero by positive numbers , and which is periodic , eventually periodic or almost periodic depending on the moments of heart contraction . Appropriate numerical simulations are provided .
