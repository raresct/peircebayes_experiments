0709.3931	q-bio.QM	Kernel methods for in silico chemogenomics	Predicting interactions between small molecules and proteins is a crucial ingredient of the drug discovery process . In particular , accurate predictive models are increasingly used to preselect potential lead compounds from large molecule databases , or to screen for side-effects . While classical in silico approaches focus on predicting interactions with a given specific target , new chemogenomics approaches adopt cross-target views . Building on recent developments in the use of kernel methods in bio- and chemoinformatics , we present a systematic framework to screen the chemical space of small molecules for interaction with the biological space of proteins . We show that this framework allows information sharing across the targets , resulting in a dramatic improvement of ligand prediction accuracy for three important classes of drug targets : enzymes , GPCR and ion channels .

Recently , several receptors , including cadherins , were found to bind ligands with a lifetime of order of one second . Here we show at the single molecule level that homotypic C-cadherin association involves transient intermediates lasting less than a few tens of milliseconds . Further , these intermediates transitionned towards more stable states with a kinetic rate displaying exponential decrease with piconewton forces . These features enable cells to detect ligands or measure surrounding mechanical behaviour within a fraction of a second , much more rapidly than was previously thought .
