This model represents a typical population growth equation but with time dependent ( linearly decreasing ) population growth coefficient . Given equation admits definition of the half-life time of the non-problematic children behavior as well as a criterion for estimation of the social regulation of the children behavior .

The ( quantitative ) systems biology offers the potential to solve the Borges Dilemma , by transcending it . There have already a plenty of indications on this trend .
