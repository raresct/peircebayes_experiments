0707.3224	q-bio.GN cond-mat.soft q-bio.OT	Tight-binding modeling of charge migration in DNA devices	Long range charge transfer experiments in DNA oligomers and the subsequently measured -- and very diverse -- transport response of DNA wires in solid state experiments exemplifies the need for a thorough theoretical understanding of charge migration in DNA-based natural and artificial materials . Here we present a review of tight-binding models for DNA conduction which have the intrinsic merit of containing more structural information than plain rate-equation models while still retaining sufficient detail of the electronic properties . This allows for simulations of transport properties to be more manageable with respect to density functional theory methods or correlated first principle algorithms .
