0707.1741	q-bio.PE	Computer Simulation of Host and two Parasite Species with Ageing	The possible coexistence of one host , one aggressive parasite and one non-lethal parasite is simulated using the Penna model of biological ageing . If the aggressive parasites survive the difficult initial times where they have to adjust genetically to the proper host age , all three species may survive , though the host number may be diminished by increasing parasite aggressivity .
