0705.1974	q-bio.PE q-bio.OT	Risk perception in epidemic modeling	We investigate the effects of risk perception in a simple model of epidemic spreading . We assume that the perception of the risk of being infected depends on the fraction of neighbors that are ill . The effect of this factor is to decrease the infectivity , that therefore becomes a dynamical component of the model . We study the problem in the mean-field approximation and by numerical simulations for regular , random and scale-free networks . We show that for homogeneous and random networks , there is always a value of perception that stops the epidemics . In the `` worst-case '' scenario of a scale-free network with diverging input connectivity , a linear perception can not stop the epidemics ; however we show that a non-linear increase of the perception risk may lead to the extinction of the disease . This transition is discontinuous , and is not predicted by the mean-field analysis .
0705.2032	q-bio.MN q-bio.SC	Modeling the effects of HIV-1 virions and proteins on Fas-induced apoptosis of infected cells	We report a first in modeling and simulation of the effects of the HIV proteins on the ( caspase dependent ) apoptotic pathway in infected cells . This work is novel and is an extension on the recent reports and clarifications on the FAS apoptotic pathway from the literature . We have gathered most of the reaction rates and initial conditions from the literature , the rest of the constants have been computed by fitting our model to the experimental results reported . Using the model obtained we have then run the simulations for the infected memory T cells , called also latent T cells , which , at the moment , represent the major obstacle to finding a cure for HIV . We can now report that the infected latent T cells have an estimated lifetime of about 42 hours from the moment they are re-activated . As far as we know this is the first result of this type obtained for the infected memory T cells .
