0710.2561	q-bio.BM	Crystallography without crystals I : the common-line method for assembling a 3D intensity volume from single-particle scattering	We demonstrate that a common-line method can assemble a 3D oversampled diffracted intensity distribution suitable for high-resolution structure solution from a set of measured 2D diffraction patterns , as proposed in experiments with an X-ray free electron laser ( XFEL ) ( Neutze { \it et al . } , 2000 ) . Even for a flat Ewald sphere , we show how the ambiguities due to Friedel 's Law may be overcome . The method breaks down for photon counts below about 10 per detector pixel , almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than expected for scattering by a 500 kDa protein with an XFEL beam focused to a 0.1 micron diameter spot . Even if 10**3 orientationally similar diffraction patterns could be identified and added to reach the requisite photon count per pixel , the need for about 10**6 orientational classes for high-resolution structure determination suggests that about ~ 10**9 diffraction patterns must be recorded . Assuming pulse and read-out rates of 100 Hz , such measurements would require ~ 10**7 seconds , i.e . several months of continuous beam time .
