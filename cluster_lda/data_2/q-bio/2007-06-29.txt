0706.4396	q-bio.GN	Silver staining of proteins in polyacrylamide gels	Silver staining is used to detect proteins after electrophoretic separation on polyacrylamide gels . It combines excellent sensitivity ( in the low nanogram range ) with the use of very simple and cheap equipment and chemicals . It is compatible with downstream processing , such as mass spectrometry analysis after protein digestion . The sequential phases of silver staining are protein fixation , then sensitization , then silver impregnation and finally image development . Several variants of silver staining are described here , which can be completed in a time range from 2 h to 1 d after the end of the electrophoretic separation . Once completed , the stain is stable for several weeks .
0707.0026	q-bio.GN math.PR q-bio.MN	Introducing a Probabilistic Structure on Sequential Dynamical Systems , Simulation and Reduction of Probabilistic Sequential Networks	A probabilistic structure on sequential dynamical systems is introduced here , the new model will be called Probabilistic Sequential Network , PSN . The morphisms of Probabilistic Sequential Networks are defined using two algebraic conditions . It is proved here that two homomorphic Probabilistic Sequential Networks have the same equilibrium or steady state probabilities if the morphism is either an epimorphism or a monomorphism . Additionally , the proof of the set of PSN with its morphisms form the category PSN , having the category of sequential dynamical systems SDS , as a full subcategory is given . Several examples of morphisms , subsystems and simulations are given .
