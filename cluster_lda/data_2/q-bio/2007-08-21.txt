Since the first member of tetracycline family were isolated , the clinical importance of these compounds as therapeutic and prophylactic agents against a wide range of infections has stimulated efforts to define their mode of action as inhibitors of bacterial reproduction . We used three SAR methodologies for the analysis of biological activity of a set of 104 tetracycline compounds . Our calculation were carried out using the semi-empirical Austin Method One ( AM1 ) and Parametric Method 3 ( PM3 ) . Electronic Indices Methodology ( EIM ) , Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) and Artificial Neural Networks ( ANN ) were applied to the classification of 14 old and 90 new proposed derivatives of tetracyclines . Our results make evident the importance of EIM descriptors in pattern recognition and also show that the EIM can be effectively used to predict the biological activity of Tetracyclines .
