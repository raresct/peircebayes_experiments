Backward simulations , also called coalescent-based simulations , are computationally very efficient . However , this framework imposes several limitations that forward simulation does not . In this work , a new simple and efficient model to perform forward simulation of populations and/or genomes is proposed . The basic idea considers an individual as the differences ( mutations ) between this individual and a reference or consensus genotype . Thus , this individual is no longer represented by its complete sequence or genotype . An example of the efficiency of the new model with respect to a more classical forward one is demonstrated . This example models the evolution of HIV resistance using the B_FR.HXB2 reference sequence to study the emergence of known resistance mutants to Zidovudine and Didanosine drugs
