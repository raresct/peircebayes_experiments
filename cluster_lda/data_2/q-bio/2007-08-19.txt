0708.2527	q-bio.BM	Model for processive nucleotide and repeat additions by the telomerase	A model is presented to describe the nucleotide and repeat addition processivity by the telomerase . In the model , the processive nucleotide addition is implemented on the basis of two requirements : One is that stem IV loop stimulates the chemical reaction of nucleotide incorporation , and the other one is the existence of an ssRNA-binding site adjacent to the polymerase site that has a high affinity for the unpaired base of the template . The unpairing of DNA : RNA hybrid after the incorporation of the nucleotide paired with the last base on the template , which is the prerequisite for repeat addition processivity , is caused by a force acting on the primer . The force is resulted from the unfolding of stem III pseudoknot that is induced by the swinging of stem IV loop towards the nucleotide-bound polymerase site . Based on the model , the dynamics of processive nucleotide and repeat additions by Tetrahymena telomerase are quantitatively studied , which give good explanations to the previous experimental results . Moreover , some predictions are presented . In particular , it is predicted that the repeat addition processivity is mainly determined by the difference between the free energy required to disrupt the DNA : RNA hybrid and that required to unfold the stem III pseudoknot , with the large difference corresponding to a low repeat addition processivity while the small one corresponding to a high repeat addition processivity .
