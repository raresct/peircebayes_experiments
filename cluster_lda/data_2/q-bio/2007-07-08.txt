At a microscopic scale , it has been seen that actin polymerization at the leading edge of cell membrane primarily helps the cell to spread depending upon its extra-cellular environment which influences the polymerization process via some receptors on the cell membrane . There are some interesting experimental results at macroscopic scales ( cell size ) where people have observed various dynamic phases in terms of spreading rate of cell area adhering to the substrate . In the present paper we develop a very simple phenomenological model to capture these dynamic apparent phases of a spreading cell without going into the microscopic details of actin polymerization .
