Considering nucleotides , codons , DNA and RNA sequences , amino acids , and proteins as information systems , we have formulated the corresponding p-adic formalisms for their investigations . Each of these systems has its characteristic prime number used for construction of the related information space . Relevance of this approach is illustrated by some examples . In particular , it is shown that degeneration of the genetic code is a p-adic phenomenon . We have also put forward a hypothesis on evolution of the genetic code assuming that primitive code was based on single nucleotides and chronologically first four amino acids . This formalism of p-adic genomic information systems can be implemented in computer programs and applied to various concrete cases .

An important example is the Rvachev-Longini model [ { \it Math . Biosci . } { \bf 75 } , 3-22 ( 1985 ) ] which is widely used in computational epidemiology . Few analytical results are however available and in particular little is known about paths followed by epidemics and disease arrival times . We study the arrival time of a disease in a city as a function of the starting seed of the epidemics . We propose an analytical Ansatz , test it in the case of a spreading on the world wide air transportation network , and show that it predicts accurately the arrival order of a disease in world-wide cities .
