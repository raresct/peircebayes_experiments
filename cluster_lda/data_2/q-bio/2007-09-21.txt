0709.3359	q-bio.BM	Transition states in protein folding kinetics : Modeling Phi-values of small beta-sheet proteins	Small single-domain proteins often exhibit only a single free-energy barrier , or transition state , between the denatured and the native state . The folding kinetics of these proteins is usually explored via mutational analysis . A central question is which structural information on the transition state can be derived from the mutational data . In this article , we model and structurally interpret mutational Phi-values for two small beta-sheet proteins , the PIN and the FBP WW domain . The native structure of these WW domains comprises two beta-hairpins that form a three-stranded beta-sheet . In our model , we assume that the transition state consists of two conformations in which either one of the hairpins is formed . Such a transition state has been recently observed in Molecular Dynamics folding-unfolding simulations of a small designed three-stranded beta-sheet protein . We obtain good agreement with the experimental data ( i ) by splitting up the mutation-induced free-energy changes into terms for the two hairpins and for the small hydrophobic core of the proteins , and ( ii ) by fitting a single parameter , the relative degree to which hairpin 1 and 2 are formed in the transition state . The model helps to understand how mutations affect the folding kinetics of WW domains , and captures also negative Phi-values that have been difficult to interpret .
