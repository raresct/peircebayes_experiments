0705.2286	q-bio.PE	An accurate model for genetic hitch-hiking	We suggest a simple deterministic approximation for the growth of the favoured-allele frequency during a selective sweep . Using this approximation we introduce an accurate model for genetic hitch-hiking . Only when Ns < 10 ( N is the population size and s denotes the selection coefficient ) , are discrepancies between our approximation and direct numerical simulations of a Moran model noticeable . Our model describes the gene genealogies of a contiguous segment of neutral loci close to the selected one , and it does not assume that the selective sweep happens instantaneously . This enables us to compute SNP distributions on the neutral segment without bias .
0705.2355	q-bio.BM q-bio.GN	In silico evidence of the relationship between miRNAs and siRNAs	Both short interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) and microRNAs ( miRNAs ) mediate the repression of specific sequences of mRNA through the RNA interference pathway . In the last years several experiments have supported the hypothesis that siRNAs and miRNAs may be functionally interchangeable , at least in cultured cells . In this work we verify that this hypothesis is also supported by a computational evidence . We show that a method specifically trained to predict the activity of the exogenous siRNAs assigns a high silencing level to experimentally determined human miRNAs . This result not only supports the idea of siRNAs and miRNAs equivalence but indicates that it is possible to use computational tools developed using synthetic small interference RNAs to investigate endogenous miRNAs .
