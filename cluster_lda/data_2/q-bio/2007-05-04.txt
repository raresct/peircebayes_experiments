0705.0666	q-bio.QM q-bio.MN	Validating module network learning algorithms using simulated data	In recent years , several authors have used probabilistic graphical models to learn expression modules and their regulatory programs from gene expression data . Here , we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator SynTReN for the purpose of testing and comparing module network learning algorithms . We introduce a software package for learning module networks , called LeMoNe , which incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs . Novelties include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct the regulatory programs , and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign regulators to the regulation program nodes . Using SynTReN data , we test the performance of LeMoNe in a completely controlled situation and assess the effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing software package , namely Genomica . Additionally , we assess the effect of various parameters , such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise , on the inference performance . Overall , application of Genomica and LeMoNe to simulated data sets gave comparable results . However , LeMoNe offers some advantages , one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster for larger data sets . Additionally , we show that the location of the regulators in the LeMoNe regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to prioritize regulators for functional validation , and that the combination of the bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment of regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden regulators .
