0710.2555	q-bio.QM	Geometric Aspects of Biological Sequence Comparison	We propose a general framework for converting global and local similarities between biological sequences to quasi-metrics . In contrast to previous works , our formulation allows asymmetric distances , originating from uneven weighting of strings , that may induce non-trivial partial orders on sets of biosequences . Furthermore , the $ \ell^p $ -type distances considered are more general than traditional generalized string edit distances corresponding to the $ \ell^1 $ case , and enable conversion of sequence similarities to distances for a much wider class of scoring schemes . Our constructions require much less restrictive gap penalties than the ones regularly used . Numerous examples are provided to illustrate the concepts introduced and their potential applications .
