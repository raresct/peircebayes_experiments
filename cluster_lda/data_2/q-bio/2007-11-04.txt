The approach , named `Viral Tiling Theory ' , is inspired by the theory of quasicrystals , where aperiodic Penrose tilings enjoy 5-fold and 10-fold local symmetries . This paper analyzes the extent to which this classification approach informs dynamical properties of the viral capsids , in particular the pattern of Raman active modes of vibrations , which can be observed experimentally .

Recently , it was proposed that this transition is uncorrelated among different cells in the colony . Motivated by several discovered signaling mechanisms which create colony-level responses , we present a model for the influence of quorum-sensing signals on a colony of B. Subtilis cells during the transition to genetic competence . Coupling to the external signal creates an effective inhibitory mechanism , which results in anti-correlation between the cycles of adjacent cells . We show that this scenario is consistent with the specific experimental measurement , which fails to detect some underlying collective signaling mechanisms . Rather , we suggest other parameters that should be used to verify the role of a quorum-sensing signal . We also study the conditions under which phenotypic spatial patterns may emerge .
