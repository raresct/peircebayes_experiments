0711.3812	q-bio.MN q-bio.PE	Regulatory control and the costs and benefits of biochemical noise	Experiments in recent years have vividly demonstrated that gene expression can be highly stochastic . How protein concentration fluctuations affect the growth rate of a population of cells , is , however , a wide open question . We present a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of protein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of genetically identical cells . The model predicts that the population 's growth rate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein concentration , the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations , and the correlation time of these fluctuations . The model also predicts that when the average concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the growth rate , fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate . However , when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the optimal level , fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population , even when the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration . The model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity , such as the average protein expression level or its variance , is in general not equal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its descendants . We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene regulatory control . Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of a gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of synthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the fluctuations in the expression of its target gene . We discuss possible experiments that could test our predictions .
