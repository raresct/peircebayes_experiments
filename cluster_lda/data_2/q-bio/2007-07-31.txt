0707.4533	q-bio.PE	Cascade of Complexity in Evolving Predator-Prey Dynamics	We simulate an individual-based model that represents both the phenotype and genome of digital organisms with predator-prey interactions . We show how open-ended growth of complexity arises from the invariance of genetic evolution operators with respect to changes in the complexity , and that the dynamics which emerges is controlled by a non-equilibrium critical point . The mechanism is analogous to the development of the cascade in fluid turbulence .
