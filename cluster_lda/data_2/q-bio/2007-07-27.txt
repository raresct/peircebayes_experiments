0707.4174	q-bio.SC q-bio.BM	Retinoblastoma protein is the likely common effector for distinct anti-aging pathways	The multiple worlds of genetically manipulated laboratory organisms such as transgenic mice or worms with certain gene mutations are somewhat reminiscent of parallel worlds in quantum mechanics . So are various models of aging tested in such organisms . In this context , the tumor suppressor p53 has been found to either accelerate or delay aging , the latter , for instance , in conjunction with ARF , another tumor suppressor , as shown very recently . To more easily determine which of these artificial settings comes closest to real life , I discuss here their features in the light of my protein structure-based insights that have led me to propose a physiological anti-aging role for the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ( RB ) over the past four years .
