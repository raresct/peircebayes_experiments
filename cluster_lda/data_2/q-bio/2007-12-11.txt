0712.1852	q-bio.MN q-bio.SC	Diffusion , dimensionality and noise in transcriptional regulation	The precision of biochemical signaling is limited by randomness in the diffusive arrival of molecules at their targets . For proteins binding to the specific sites on the DNA and regulating transcription , the ability of the proteins to diffuse in one dimension by sliding along the length of the DNA , in addition to their diffusion in bulk solution , would seem to generate a larger target for DNA binding , consequently reducing the noise in the occupancy of the regulatory site . Here we show that this effect is largely cancelled by the enhanced temporal correlations in one dimensional diffusion . With realistic parameters , sliding along DNA has surprisingly little effect on the physical limits to the precision of transcriptional regulation .
