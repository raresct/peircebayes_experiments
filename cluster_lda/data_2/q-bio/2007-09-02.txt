Often , though , one finds that systems of interest in these fields are dauntingly complex . In this paper , we attempt to synthesize and expand upon the body of mathematical results pertaining to the theory of multiple equilibria in chemical reaction networks ( CRNs ) , which has yielded surprising insights with minimal computational effort . Our central focus is a recent , cycle-based theorem by Gheorghe Craciun and Martin Feinberg , which is of significant interest in its own right and also serves , in a somewhat restated form , as the basis for a number of fruitful connections among related results .
