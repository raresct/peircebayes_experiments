The crossover manifests itself in the transition from n=5/3 to n=3 . Our microscopic model represents a single lipid molecule as a worm-like chain with finite irreducible cross-section area A_0 , flexural rigidity K and stretching modulus Q in a parabolic potential with self-consistent curvature B ( A ) formed by entropic interactions between hydrocarbon chains in the lipid layer . The crossover area per lipid A* obeys relation Q^2/ ( KB ( A* ) ) ~1 . We predict a peculiar possibility to deduce effective elastic moduli K and Q of the individual hydrocarbon chain from the analysis of the isotherm possessing such crossover . Also calculated is crossover-related behavior of the area compressibility modulus K_a , equilibrium area per lipid A_t , and chain order parameter S .

0706.3137	q-bio.BM math.CO	Asymptotic Enumeration of RNA Structures with Pseudoknots	In this paper we present the asymptotic enumeration of RNA structures with pseudoknots . We develop a general framework for the computation of exponential growth rate and the sub exponential factors for $ k $ -noncrossing RNA structures . Our results are based on the generating function for the number of $ k $ -noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures , $ { \sf S } _k ( n ) $ , derived in \cite { Reidys:07pseu } , where $ k-1 $ denotes the maximal size of sets of mutually intersecting bonds . We prove a functional equation for the generating function $ \sum_ { n\ge 0 } { \sf S } _k ( n ) z^n $ and obtain for $ k=2 $ and $ k=3 $ the analytic continuation and singular expansions , respectively . It is implicit in our results that for arbitrary $ k $ singular expansions exist and via transfer theorems of analytic combinatorics we obtain asymptotic expression for the coefficients . We explicitly derive the asymptotic expressions for 2- and 3-noncrossing RNA structures . Our main result is the derivation of the formula $ { \sf S } _3 ( n ) \sim \frac { 10.4724\cdot 4 ! } { n ( n-1 ) ... ( n-4 ) } ( \frac { 5+\sqrt { 21 } } { 2 } ) ^n $ .
0706.3177	q-bio.NC	Role of homeostasis in learning sparse representations	Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields . One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes . Furthermore , it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation , that is , where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active . Indeed , different models of sparse coding , coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis , have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response . However , the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown . By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning , we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm . We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms . Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results , the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons . Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair . By contributing to optimizing statistical competition across neurons , homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components .
0706.3195	q-bio.BM	Genetic Transferability of Anomalous Irradiation Alterations of Antibiotic Activity	It previously has been discovered that visible light irradiation of crystalline substrates can lead to enhancement of subsequent enzymatic reaction rates as sharply peaked oscillatory functions of irradiation time . The particular activating irradiation times can vary with source of a given enzyme and thus , presumably , its molecular structure . The experiments reported here demonstrate that the potential for this anomalous enzyme reaction rate enhancement can be transferred from one bacterial species to another coincident with transfer of the genetic determinant for the relevant enzyme . In particular , the effect of crystal-irradiated chloramphenicol on growth of bacterial strains in which a transferable R-factor DNA plasmid coding for chloramphenicol resistance was or was not present ( S. panama R+ , E. coli R+ , and E. coli R- ) was determined . Chloramphenicol samples irradiated 10 , 35 and 60 sec produced increased growth rates ( diminished inhibition ) for the resistant S. panama and E. coli strains , while having no such effect on growth rate of the sensitive E. coli strain . Consistent with past findings , chloramphenicol samples irradiated 5 , 30 and 55 sec produced decreased growth rates ( increased inhibition ) for all three strains .

With the advent of high-throughput profiling methods , interest in reverse engineering the structure and dynamics of biochemical networks is high . Recently an algorithm for reverse engineering of biochemical networks was developed by Laubenbacher and Stigler . It is a top-down approach using time discrete dynamical systems . One of its key steps includes the choice of a term order . The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets to be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets . We found minimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be reverse engineered display . Furthermore , we identified optimal data sets , which we characterized using a geometric property called `` general position '' . Moreover , we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets , provided a codimensional condition is fulfilled . In addition , we present a generalization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term order . For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the correct model , provided the data set used is optimal . We analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of variables n ( i.e . interacting chemicals ) . Unfortunately , this formula converges to zero as fast as r^ ( q^n ) , where q is a natural number and 0 < r < 1 . Therefore , even if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders are overcome , the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible , unless prodigious amounts of data are available . Such large data sets are experimentally impossible to generate with today 's technologies .
