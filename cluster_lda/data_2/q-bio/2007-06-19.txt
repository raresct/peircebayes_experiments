This architecture is composed of computing paths consisting of neurons and synapses only . These paths have been decomposed into lateral , longitudinal and vertical components . Cortical computation has then been decomposed into lateral computation ( LaC ) , longitudinal computation ( LoC ) and vertical computation ( VeC ) . It has been shown that various loop structures in the cortical circuit play important roles in cortical computation as well as in memory storage and retrieval , keeping in conformity with the molecular basis of short and long term memory . A new learning scheme for the brain has also been proposed and how it is implemented within the proposed architecture has been explained . A number of mathematical results about the architecture have been proposed , many of which without proof .
