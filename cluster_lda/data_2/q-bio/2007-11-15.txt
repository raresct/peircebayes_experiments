0711.2346	q-bio.BM	$ k $ -noncrossing RNA structures with arc-length $ \ge 3 $	In this paper we enumerate $ k $ -noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures with given minimum arc- and stack-length . That is , we study the numbers of RNA pseudoknot structures with arc-length $ \ge 3 $ , stack-length $ \ge \sigma $ and in which there are at most $ k-1 $ mutually crossing bonds , denoted by $ { \sf T } _ { k , \sigma } ^ { [ 3 ] } ( n ) $ . In particular we prove that the numbers of 3 , 4 and 5-noncrossing RNA structures with arc-length $ \ge 3 $ and stack-length $ \ge 2 $ satisfy $ { \sf T } _ { 3,2 } ^ { [ 3 ] } ( n ) ^ { } \sim K_3 n^ { -5 } 2.5723^n $ , $ { \sf T } ^ { [ 3 ] } _ { 4,2 } ( n ) \sim K_4 n^ { - { 21/2 } } 3.0306^n $ , and $ { \sf T } ^ { [ 3 ] } _ { 5,2 } ( n ) \sim K_5 n^ { -18 } 3.4092^n $ , respectively , where $ K_3 , K_4 , K_5 $ are constants . Our results are of importance for prediction algorithms for RNA pseudoknot structures .

We demonstrate that such noise-driven switching is dominated by tails of probability distributions and is therefore exponentially sensitive to changes in physiological parameters such as transcription and translation rates . However , provided mRNA lifetimes are short , switching can still be accurately simulated using protein-only models of gene expression . Exponential sensitivity limits the robustness of noise-driven switching , suggesting cells may use other mechanisms in order to switch reliably .
0711.2520	q-bio.QM q-bio.GN	Mixed membership analysis of genome-wide expression data	Learning latent expression themes that best express complex patterns in a sample is a central problem in data mining and scientific research . For example , in computational biology we seek a set of salient gene expression themes that explain a biological process , extracting them from a large pool of gene expression profiles . In this paper , we introduce probabilistic models to learn such latent themes in an unsupervised fashion . Our models capture contagion , i.e. , dependence among multiple occurrences of the same feature , using a hierarchical Bayesian scheme . Contagion is a convenient analytical formalism to characterize semantic themes underlying observed feature patterns , such as biological context . We present model variants tailored to different properties of biological data , and we outline a general variational inference scheme for approximate posterior inference . We validate our methods on both simulated data and realistic high-throughput gene expression profiles via SAGE . Our results show improved predictions of gene functions over existing methods based on stronger independence assumptions , and demonstrate feasibility of a promising hierarchical Bayesian formalism for soft clustering and latent aspects analysis .
0711.2525	q-bio.BM q-bio.QM	Thermodynamic behavior of short oligonucleotides in microarray hybridizations can be described using Gibbs free energy in a nearest-neighbor model	While designing oligonucleotide-based microarrays , cross-hybridization between surface-bound oligos and non-intended labeled targets is probably the most difficult parameter to predict . Although literature describes rules-of-thumb concerning oligo length , overall similarity , and continuous stretches , the final behavior is difficult to predict . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of well-defined mismatches on hybridization specificity using CodeLink Activated Slides , and to study quantitatively the relation between hybridization intensity and Gibbs free energy ( Delta G ) , taking the mismatches into account . Our data clearly showed a correlation between the hybridization intensity and Delta G of the oligos over three orders of magnitude for the hybridization intensity , which could be described by the Langmuir model . As Delta G was calculated according to the nearest-neighbor model , using values related to DNA hybridizations in solution , this study clearly shows that target-probe hybridizations on microarrays with a three-dimensional coating are in quantitative agreement with the corresponding reaction in solution . These results can be interesting for some practical applications . The correlation between intensity and Delta G can be used in quality control of microarray hybridizations by designing probes and corresponding RNA spikes with a range of Delta G values . Furthermore , this correlation might be of use to fine-tune oligonucleotide design algorithms in a way to improve the prediction of the influence of mismatching targets on microarray hybridizations .
0711.2531	q-bio.PE	Multimodal pattern formation in phenotype distributions of sexual populations	During bouts of evolutionary diversification , such as adaptive radiations , the emerging species cluster around different locations in phenotype space , How such multimodal patterns in phenotype space can emerge from a single ancestral species is a fundamental question in biology . Frequency-dependent competition is one potential mechanism for such pattern formation , as has previously been shown in models based on the theory of adaptive dynamics . Here we demonstrate that also in models similar to those used in quantitative genetics , phenotype distributions can split into multiple modes under the force of frequency-dependent competition . In sexual populations , this requires assortative mating , and we show that the multimodal splitting of initially unimodal distributions occurs over a range of assortment parameters . In addition , assortative mating can be favoured evolutionarily even if it incurs costs , because it provides a means of alleviating the effects of frequency dependence . Our results reveal that models at both ends of the spectrum between essentially monomorphic ( adaptive dynamics ) and fully polymorphic ( quantitative genetics ) yield similar results . This underscores that frequency-dependent selection is a strong agent of pattern formation in phenotype distributions , potentially resulting in adaptive speciation .
