0712.3897	q-bio.QM q-bio.NC	Topological Maps from Signals	We discuss the task of reconstructing the topological map of an environment based on the sequences of locations visited by a mobile agent -- this occurs in systems neuroscience , where one runs into the task of reconstructing the global topological map of the environment based on activation patterns of the place coding cells in hippocampus area of the brain . A similar task appears in the context of establishing wifi connectivity maps .
0712.3900	q-bio.QM	Integrating heterogeneous knowledges for understanding biological behaviors : a probabilistic approach	Despite recent molecular technique improvements , biological knowledge remains incomplete . Reasoning on living systems hence implies to integrate heterogeneous and partial informations . Although current investigations successfully focus on qualitative behaviors of macromolecular networks , others approaches show partial quantitative informations like protein concentration variations over times . We consider that both informations , qualitative and quantitative , have to be combined into a modeling method to provide a better understanding of the biological system . We propose here such a method using a probabilistic-like approach . After its exhaustive description , we illustrate its advantages by modeling the carbon starvation response in Escherichia coli . In this purpose , we build an original qualitative model based on available observations . After the formal verification of its qualitative properties , the probabilistic model shows quantitative results corresponding to biological expectations which confirm the interest of our probabilistic approach .
