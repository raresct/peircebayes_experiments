The balance equations for the cancer cells of two phenotypes with random switching between cell proliferation and migration are derived . The transport of tumor cells is formulated in terms of the CTRW with an arbitrary waiting time distribution law , while proliferation is modelled by a logistic growth . The overall rate of tumor cell invasion for normal diffusion and subdiffusion is determined .
0711.1405	q-bio.BM	RNA-LEGO : Combinatorial Design of Pseudoknot RNA	In this paper we enumerate $ k $ -noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures with given minimum stack-length . We show that the numbers of $ k $ -noncrossing structures without isolated base pairs are significantly smaller than the number of all $ k $ -noncrossing structures . In particular we prove that the number of 3- and 4-noncrossing RNA structures with stack-length $ \ge 2 $ is for large $ n $ given by $ 311.2470 \frac { 4 ! } { n ( n-1 ) ... ( n-4 ) } 2.5881^n $ and $ 1.217\cdot 10^ { 7 } n^ { - { 21/2 } } 3.0382^n $ , respectively . We furthermore show that for $ k $ -noncrossing RNA structures the drop in exponential growth rates between the number of all structures and the number of all structures with stack-size $ \ge 2 $ increases significantly . Our results are of importance for prediction algorithms for pseudoknot-RNA and provide evidence that there exist neutral networks of RNA pseudoknot structures .
