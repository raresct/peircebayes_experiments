Genechip oligonucleotide microarrays have been used widely for transcriptional profiling of a large number of genes in a given paradigm . Gene expression estimation precedes biological inference and is given as a complex combination of atomic entities on the array called probes . These probe intensities are further classified into perfect-match ( PM ) and mis-match ( MM ) probes . While former is a measure of specific binding , the lat-ter is a measure of non-specific binding . The behavior of the MM probes has especially proven to be elusive . The present study investigates qualita-tive similarities in the distributional signatures and local correlation struc-tures/patchiness between the PM and MM probe intensities . These qualita-tive similarities are established on publicly available microarrays generated across laboratories investigating the same paradigm . Persistence of these similarities across raw as well as background subtracted probe intensities is also investigated . The results presented raise fundamental concerns in inter-preting Genechip oligonucleotide microarray data .
