The computed distributions remarkably agree with the worm-like chain theory for double helices of one helical turn and longer , and qualitatively differ from predictions of the semi-elastic chain model . The computed data exhibit only small anomalies in the apparent flexibility of short DNA and can not account for the recently reported AFM data ( Wiggins et al , Nature nanotechnology 1 , 137 ( 2006 ) ) . It is possible that the current atomistic DNA models miss some essential mechanisms of DNA bending on intermediate length scales . Analysis of bent DNA structures reveals , however , that the bending motion is structurally heterogeneous and directionally anisotropic on the intermediate length scales where the experimental anomalies were detected . These effects are essential for interpretation of the experimental data and they also can be responsible for the apparent discrepancy .
