Here we study the rate-geometry relationship with a simple statistical physics model , and focus on two classes of model geometries , representing ideal parallel and antiparallel structures . We find that the logarithm of the rate shows an almost perfect linear correlation with the '' absolute contact order '' , but the slope depends on the particular class considered . We discuss these findings in the light of experimental results .

Focusing on protein 1BBL , a candidate for downhill folding behavior , and comparing it to the WW domain of protein PIN1 , a two-state folder of comparable size , the authors show that there are qualitative differences in both the equilibrium and kinetic properties of the two molecules . However , the barrierless scenario which would be expected if 1BBL were a true downhill folder is observed only at low enough temperature .
