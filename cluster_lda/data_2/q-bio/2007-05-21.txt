0705.2816	q-bio.MN	Viable flux distribution in metabolic networks	The metabolic networks are very well characterized for a large set of organisms , a unique case in within the large-scale biological networks . For this reason they provide a a very interesting framework for the construction of analytically tractable statistical mechanics models . In this paper we introduce a solvable model for the distribution of fluxes in the metabolic network . We show that the effect of the topology on the distribution of fluxes is to allow for large fluctuations of their values , a fact that should have implications on the robustness of the system .

Results : Here , it is found based on empirical data that , despite this heterogeneity , the volume-specific cerebral glucose metabolic rate of many different brain structures scales with brain volume with almost the same exponent around -0.15 . The exception is white matter , the metabolism of which seems to scale with a standard specific exponent -1/4 . The scaling exponents for the total oxygen and glucose consumptions in the brain in relation to its volume are identical and equal to $ 0.86\pm 0.03 $ , which is significantly larger than the exponents 3/4 and 2/3 suggested for whole body basal metabolism on body mass . Conclusions : These findings show explicitly that in mammals ( i ) volume-specific scaling exponents of the cerebral energy expenditure in different brain parts are approximately constant ( except brain stem structures ) , and ( ii ) the total cerebral metabolic exponent against brain volume is greater than the much-cited Kleiber 's 3/4 exponent . The neurophysiological factors that might account for the regional uniformity of the exponents and for the excessive scaling of the total brain metabolism are discussed , along with the relationship between brain metabolic scaling and computation .
