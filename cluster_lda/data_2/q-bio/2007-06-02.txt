0706.0294	q-bio.MN q-bio.QM	Mixed membership analysis of high-throughput interaction studies : Relational data	In this paper , we consider the statistical analysis of a protein interaction network . We propose a Bayesian model that uses a hierarchy of probabilistic assumptions about the way proteins interact with one another in order to : ( i ) identify the number of non-observable functional modules ; ( ii ) estimate the degree of membership of proteins to modules ; and ( iii ) estimate typical interaction patterns among the functional modules themselves . Our model describes large amount of ( relational ) data using a relatively small set of parameters that we can reliably estimate with an efficient inference algorithm . We apply our methodology to data on protein-to-protein interactions in saccharomyces cerevisiae to reveal proteins ' diverse functional roles . The case study provides the basis for an overview of which scientific questions can be addressed using our methods , and for a discussion of technical issues .
