Binding , dissociation , diffusion and rebinding of ligands are incorporated into the theory in a systematic manner . We derive explicitly the time evolution of the ligand-bound receptor fraction p ( t ) in various regimes . Contrary to the commonly accepted view , we find that the well-known Berg-Purcell scaling for the association rate is modified as a function of time . Specifically , the effective on-rate changes non-monotonically as a function of time and equals the intrinsic rate at very early as well as late times , while being approximately equal to the Berg-Purcell value at intermediate times . The effective dissociation rate , as it appears in the binding curve or measured in a dissociation experiment , is strongly modified by rebinding events and assumes the Berg-Purcell value except at very late times , where the decay is algebraic and not exponential . In equilibrium , the ligand concentration everywhere in the solution is the same and equals its spatial mean , thus ensuring that there is no depletion in the vicinity of the cell . Implications of our results for binding experiments and numerical simulations of ligand-receptor systems are also discussed .
