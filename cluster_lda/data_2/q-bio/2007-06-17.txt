In this paper we explore the question of whether one can reconstruct a pedigree by just observing sequence data for present day individuals . This is motivated by the increasing availability of genomic sequences , but in this paper we take a more theoretical approach and consider what models of sequence evolution might allow pedigree reconstruction ( given sufficiently long sequences ) . Our results complement recent work that showed that pedigree reconstruction may be fundamentally impossible if one uses just the degrees of relatedness between different extant individuals . We find that for certain stochastic processes , pedigrees can be recovered up to isomorphism from sufficiently long sequences .
