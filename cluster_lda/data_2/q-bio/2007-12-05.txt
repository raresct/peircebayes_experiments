The power spectral density ( PSD ) of these signals has the power-law form $ P ( f ) \sim f^ { -\chi } $ from 80 to 500 Hz . This scaling index $ \chi = 4.0\pm 0.1 $ is universal , across subjects , area in the cortex , and local neural activity levels . The shape of the PSD does not change with local cortex activity , only its amplitude increases . We observe a knee in the spectra at $ f_0\simeq 70 $ Hz , implying the existence of a characteristic time scale $ \tau= ( 2\pi f_0 ) ^ { -1 } \simeq 2-4 $ msec . For $ f < f_0 $ we find evidence for a power-law with $ \chi_L\simeq 2.0\pm 0.4 $ .

The approach uses a physico-chemical model which includes the effects the specific and non-specific hybridisation and probe folding at the microarray surface , target folding and hybridisation in the bulk RNA target solution , and duplex dissociation during the post-hybridisatoin washing phase . The model predicts a three parameter hyperbolic response function that fits well with fluorescence intensity data from all three datasets . The importance of the various hybridisation and washing effects in determining each of the three parameters is examined , and some guidance is given as to how a practical algorithm for determining specific target concentrations might be developed .
