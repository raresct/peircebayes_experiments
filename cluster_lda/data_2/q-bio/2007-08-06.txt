0708.0703	q-bio.NC q-bio.SC	Detection of subthreshold pulses in neurons with channel noise	Neurons are subject to various kinds of noise . In addition to synaptic noise , the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels represents an intrinsic source of noise that affects the signal processing properties of the neuron . In this paper , we studied the response of a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron to transient input subthreshold pulses . It was found that the average response time decreases but variance increases as the amplitude of channel noise increases . In the case of single pulse detection , we show that channel noise enables one neuron to detect the subthreshold signals and an optimal membrane area ( or channel noise intensity ) exists for a single neuron to achieve optimal performance . However , the detection ability of a single neuron is limited by large errors . Here , we test a simple neuronal network that can enhance the pulse detecting abilities of neurons and find dozens of neurons can perfectly detect subthreshold pulses . The phenomenon of intrinsic stochastic resonance is also found both at the level of single neurons and at the level of networks . At the network level , the detection ability of networks can be optimized for the number of neurons comprising the network .
