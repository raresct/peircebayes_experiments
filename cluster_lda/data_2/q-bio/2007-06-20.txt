0706.3067	q-bio.TO	Fitting analysis provides further evidence for eradication of hiv/aids infection under combined liposome drug delivery treatment	It is now evident that the commonly accepted strategy for treatment of HIV/AIDS by highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) will not lead to eradication of HIV in a reasonable time . This is straightforward from the typical exponential viral load decay upon treatment revealing initial considerable but incomplete reduction of plasma HIV RNA with subsequent low level HIV persistence even in patients on effective antiretroviral therapy . Here we show that the viral load follows a simple zero trend linear regression line under different treatment approach recently proposed by us . This unambiguously indicates a whole body HIV eradication in reasonable time .
