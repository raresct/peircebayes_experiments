Kauffman proposed them in the 1960 's as models for gene regulatory networks . These systems are characterized by being defined on a Boolean state space and by simultaneous updating at discrete time steps . Of particular importance for biological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is bounded by a fixed constant , as was stressed by Kauffman in his original papers . An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule out exponentially long periodic orbits in the system . In this paper , we consider systems with positive feedback interconnections among all variables ( known as cooperative systems ) , which in a continuous setting guarantees a very stable dynamics . We show that for an arbitrary constant 0 < c < 2 and sufficiently large n there exist n-dimensional cooperative Boolean networks in which both the indegree and outdegree of each variable is bounded by two , and which nevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n . In Part II of this paper we will prove an inverse result showing that any system with such a dynamic behavior must in a sense be similar to the example described .
