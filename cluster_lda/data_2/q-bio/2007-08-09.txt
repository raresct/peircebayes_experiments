0708.1256	q-bio.QM	Eutacticity in sea urchin evolution	An eutactic star , in a n-dimensional space , is a set of N vectors which can be viewed as the projection of N orthogonal vectors in a N-dimensional space . By adequately associating a star of vectors to a particular sea urchin we propose that a measure of the eutacticity of the star constitutes a measure of the regularity of the sea urchin . Then we study changes of regularity ( eutacticity ) in a macroevolutive and taxonomic level of sea urchins belonging to the Echinoidea Class . An analysis considering changes through geological time suggests a high degree of regularity in the shape of these organisms through their evolution . Rare deviations from regularity measured in Holasteroida order are discussed .
0708.1341	q-bio.QM q-bio.NC	An algorithm for detecting oscillatory behavior in discretized data : the damped-oscillator oscillator detector	We present a simple algorithm for detecting oscillatory behavior in discrete data . The data is used as an input driving force acting on a set of simulated damped oscillators . By monitoring the energy of the simulated oscillators , we can detect oscillatory behavior in data . In application to in vivo deep brain basal ganglia recordings , we found sharp peaks in the spectrum at 20 and 70 Hz . The algorithm is also compared to the conventional fast Fourier transform and circular statistics techniques using computer generated model data , and is found to be comparable to or better than fast Fourier transform in test cases . Circular statistics performed poorly in our tests .
