The minimization analysis shows that the overall exterior form of distribution networks is a modified ellipsoid , a geometric form that is a good approximation to the external anatomy of the kidney and lung . The variational procedure implementing this minimization is similar to the traditional isoperimetric theorems of geometry . A revised version of this preprint that expands Section 4 will be published in the Journal of Biological Systems , World Scientific Publishing .
