Its largely unknown function ( 1-5 ) is related to programming ( rather than to spontaneous mutations ) of accurate adaptation to rapidly changing environment . Programmed adaptation to the same universal law for non-competing animals from anaerobic yeast to human is revealed in the study of their extensively quantified mortality ( 6-21 ) . Adaptation of animals with removed non-coding DNA fractions may specify their contribution to genomic programming . Emergence of new adaptation programs and their ( non-Mendelian ) heredity may be studied in antibiotic mini-extinctions ( 22-24 ) . On a large evolutionary scale rapid universal adaptation was vital for survival , and evolved , in otherwise lethal for diverse species major mass extinctions ( 25-28 ) . Evolutionary and experimental data corroborate these conclusions ( 6-21 , 29-32 ) . Universal law implies certain biological universality of diverse species , thus quantifies applicability of animal models to humans ) . Genomic adaptation programming calls for unusual approach to its study and implies unanticipated perspectives , in particular , directed biological changes .
