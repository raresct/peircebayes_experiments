Prokaryotes do not have introns in their genome . We report the calculations of stability domains of actin genes for various organisms in the animal , plant and fungi kingdoms . Actin genes have been chosen because they have been highly conserved during evolution . In these genes all introns were removed so as to mimic ancient genes at the time of the early eukaryotic development , i.e . before introns insertion . Common stability boundaries are found in evolutionary distant organisms , which implies that these boundaries date from the early origin of eukaryotes . In general boundaries correspond with introns positions of vertebrates and other animals actins , but not much for plants and fungi . The sharpest boundary is found in a locus where fungi , algae and animals have introns in positions separated by one nucleotide only , which identifies a hot-spot for insertion . These results suggest that some introns may have been incorporated into the genomes through a thermodynamic driven mechanism , in agreement with previous observations on human genes . They also suggest a different mechanism for introns insertion in plants and animals .

This article reviews some recent work on theoretical problems inherent in the interpretation of TPM experiments , both in equilibrium and dynamical aspects .
