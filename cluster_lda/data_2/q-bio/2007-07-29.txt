We prove that if the probabilities of elementary expansions and contractions are equal , microsatellite expansions are always self-repairing . If these probabilities are different , self-reparation does not work . Mosaicism , anticipation and reverse mutation cases are discussed in the framework of the model . We explain these phenomena and provide some theoretical evidence for their properties , for example the rarity of reverse mutations .
0707.4321	q-bio.BM q-bio.SC	The insulin superfamily of growth-promoting proteins	Recently , structural analysis of the human transferrin and growth hormone ( GH ) amino acid sequences has unravelled that they harbor a motif identical to a pattern found in viral oncoproteins known to bind the primarily nuclear tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein ( RB ) . Since related signatures had previously been identified also in insulin and the two insulin-like growth factors ( IGFs ) , the aim of the current study has been to investigate whether further hints substantiating these reported homologies can be found in silico . Here , additional similarities are presented supporting the notion of an insulin superfamily of growth-promoting proteins with dual localization in the extracellular environment and the intracellular space , particularly in the nucleus , as well as characterized by a tropism for RB .
