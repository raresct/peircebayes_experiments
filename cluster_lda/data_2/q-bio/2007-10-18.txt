We demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of modularity in a population of individuals that evolve in a changing environment . We show that the level of modularity correlates with the rapidity and severity of environmental change . The modularity arises as a synergistic response to the noise in the environment in the presence of horizontal gene transfer . We suggest that the hierarchical structure observed in the natural world may be a broken symmetry state , which generically results from evolution in a changing environment .
