0704.1362	q-bio.QM q-bio.NC	Fast recursive filters for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems	A fast and accurate computational scheme for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems is presented . The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by a combination of components of only two different types : first-order low-pass filters and static nonlinearities . The parameters of these filters and nonlinearities may depend on system variables , and the topology of the system may be complex , including feedback . Several examples taken from neuroscience are given : phototransduction , photopigment bleaching , and spike generation according to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations . The scheme uses two slightly different forms of autoregressive filters , with an implicit delay of zero for feedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for feedback control . On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal cell it computes , for a given level of accuracy , 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than 4th-order Runge-Kutta . The computational scheme has minimal memory requirements , and is also suited for computation on a stream processor , such as a GPU ( Graphical Processing Unit ) .
0704.1390	q-bio.CB	Velocity oscillations in actin-based motility	We present a simple and generic theoretical description of actin-based motility , where polymerization of filaments maintains propulsion . The dynamics is driven by polymerization kinetics at the filaments ' free ends , crosslinking of the actin network , attachment and detachment of filaments to the obstacle interfaces and entropic forces . We show that spontaneous oscillations in the velocity emerge in a broad range of parameter values , and compare our findings with experiments .
