0711.3932	q-bio.QM	Dependence of nucleotide physical properties on their placement in codons and determinative degree	Various physical properties such as dipole moment , heat of formation and energy of the most stable formation of nucleotides and bases were calculated by PM3 ( modified neglect of diatomic overlap , parametric method number 3 ) and AM1 ( Austin model 1 ) methods . As distinct from previous calculations , for nucleotides the interaction with neighbours is taken into account up to gradient of convergence equaling 1 . The dependences of these variables from the place in the codon and the determinative degree were obtained . The difference of these variables for codons and anticodons is shown .
