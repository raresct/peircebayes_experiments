Recent work can be roughly classified into either dynamical models of well-described subsystems , or coarse-grained descriptions of the topology of the molecular networks at the scale of the whole organism . In order to bridge these two disparate approaches one needs to develop simplified descriptions of dynamics and topological measures which address the propagation of signals in molecular networks . Here , we consider the directed network of protein regulation in E. coli , characterizing its modularity in terms of its potential to transmit signals . We demonstrate that the simplest measure based on identifying sub-networks of strong components , within which each node could send a signal to every other node , indeed partitions the network into functional modules . We then suggest measures to quantify the cost and spread associated with sending a signal between any particular pair of proteins . Thereby , we address the signalling specificity within and between modules , and show that in the regulation of E.coli there is a systematic reduction of the cost and spread for signals traveling over more than two intermediate reactions .
