0704.2793	q-bio.MN q-bio.QM	Deterministic characterization of stochastic genetic circuits	For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules is small , significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events . This molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the predictions of deterministic rate equation models . Unfortunately , there are few analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems . Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise . The method allows the steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed , facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic effects and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility , in a manner not accessible to numerical simulation . By way of illustration we consider two genetic circuits : a bistable positive-feedback loop and a negative-feedback oscillator . We find in the positive feedback circuit that translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional control . Conversely , in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a positive-feedback switch , the stochasticity of transcriptional control is harnessed to generate reproducible oscillations .
