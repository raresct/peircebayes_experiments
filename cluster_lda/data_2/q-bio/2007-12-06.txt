0712.0973	q-bio.OT	Nucleosome shape dictates chromatin-fiber structure	Apart from being the gateway for all access to the eukaryotic genome , chromatin has in recent years been identified as carrying an epigenetic code regulating transcriptional activity . The detailed knowledge of this code contrasts the ignorance of the fiber structure which it regulates , and none of the suggested fiber models are capable of predicting the most basic quantities of the fiber ( diameter , nucleosome line density , etc . ) . We address this three-decade-old problem by constructing a simple geometrical model based on the nucleosome shape alone . Without fit parameters we predict the observed properties of the condensed chromatin fiber ( e.g . its 30 nm diameter ) , the structure , and how the fiber changes with varying nucleosome repeat length . Our approach further puts the plethora of previously suggested models within a coherent framework , and opens the door to detailed studies of the interplay between chromatin structure and function .
