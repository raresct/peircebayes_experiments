For example , the function of some gene-regulatory proteins depends on such DNA looping interactions . We present a new technique for characterizing the kinetics of loop formation in vitro , as observed using the tethered particle method , and apply it to experimental data on looping induced by lambda repressor . Our method uses a modified ( diffusive ) hidden Markov analysis that directly incorporates the Brownian motion of the observed tethered bead . We compare looping lifetimes found with our method ( which we find are consistent over a range of sampling frequencies ) to those obtained via the traditional threshold-crossing analysis ( which can vary depending on how the raw data are filtered in the time domain ) . Our method does not involve any time filtering and can detect sudden changes in looping behavior . For example , we show how our method can identify transitions between long-lived , kinetically distinct states that would otherwise be difficult to discern .
