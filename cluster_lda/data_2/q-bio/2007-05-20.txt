0705.2907	q-bio.SC q-bio.BM	Peeling and Sliding in Nucleosome Repositioning	We investigate the mechanisms of histone sliding and detachment with a stochastic model that couples thermally-induced , passive histone sliding with active motor-driven histone unwrapping . Analysis of a passive loop or twist defect-mediated histone sliding mechanism shows that diffusional sliding is enhanced as larger portions of the DNA is peeled off the histone . The mean times to histone detachment and the mean distance traveled by the motor complex prior to histone detachment are computed as functions of the intrinsic speed of the motor . Fast motors preferentially induce detachment over sliding . However , for a fixed motor speed , increasing the histone-DNA affinity ( and thereby decreasing the passive sliding rate ) increases the mean distance traveled by the motor .
