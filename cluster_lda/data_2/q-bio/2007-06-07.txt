0706.1017	q-bio.BM	Discrete breathers in nonlinear network models of proteins	We introduce a topology-based nonlinear network model of protein dynamics with the aim of investigating the interplay of spatial disorder and nonlinearity . We show that spontaneous localization of energy occurs generically and is a site-dependent process . Localized modes of nonlinear origin form spontaneously in the stiffest parts of the structure and display site-dependent activation energies . Our results provide a straightforward way for understanding the recently discovered link between protein local stiffness and enzymatic activity . They strongly suggest that nonlinear phenomena may play an important role in enzyme function , allowing for energy storage during the catalytic process .
0706.1102	q-bio.BM	Influence of Hydrodynamic Interactions on Mechanical Unfolding of Proteins	We incorporate hydrodynamic interactions in a structure-based model of ubiquitin and demonstrate that the hydrodynamic coupling may reduce the peak force when stretching the protein at constant speed , especially at larger speeds . Hydrodynamic interactions are also shown to facilitate unfolding at constant force and inhibit stretching by fluid flows .
