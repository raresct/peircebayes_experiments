0708.3171	q-bio.MN	The p53-MDM2 network : from oscillations to apoptosis	The p53 protein is well-known for its tumour suppressor function . The p53-MDM2 negative feedback loop constitutes the core module of a network of regulatory interactions activated under cellular stress . In normal cells , the level of p53 proteins is kept low by MDM2 , i.e . MDM2 negatively regulates the activity of p53 . In the case of DNA damage , the p53-mediated pathways are activated leading to cell cycle arrest and repair of the DNA . If repair is not possible due to excessive damage , the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway is activated bringing about cell death . In this paper , we give an overview of our studies on the p53-MDM2 module and the associated pathways from a systems biology perspective . We discuss a number of key predictions , related to some specific aspects of cell cycle arrest and cell death , which could be tested in experiments .

On the basis of effective single-strand or double-strand tight-binding models which simulate hole propagation along the DNA , a statistical analysis of charge transmission modulations associated with all possible point mutations is performed . We find that in contrast to non-cancerous mutations , mutation hotspots tend to result in significantly weaker { \em changes of transmission properties } . This suggests that charge transport could play a significant role for DNA-repairing deficiency yielding carcinogenesis .
