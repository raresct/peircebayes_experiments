0710.1421	q-bio.MN	Stochastic Simulations of the Repressilator Circuit	The genetic repressilator circuit consists of three transcription factors , or repressors , which negatively regulate each other in a cyclic manner . This circuit was synthetically constructed on plasmids in { \it Escherichia coli } and was found to exhibit oscillations in the concentrations of the three repressors . Since the repressors and their binding sites often appear in low copy numbers , the oscillations are noisy and irregular . Therefore , the repressilator circuit can not be fully analyzed using deterministic methods such as rate-equations . Here we perform stochastic analysis of the repressilator circuit using the master equation and Monte Carlo simulations . It is found that fluctuations modify the range of conditions in which oscillations appear as well as their amplitude and period , compared to the deterministic equations . The deterministic and stochastic approaches coincide only in the limit in which all the relevant components , including free proteins , plasmids and bound proteins , appear in high copy numbers . We also find that subtle features such as cooperative binding and bound-repressor degradation strongly affect the existence and properties of the oscillations .
