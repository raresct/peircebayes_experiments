0707.2300	q-bio.BM	Vibrational energy relaxation ( VER ) of isotopically labeled amide I modes in cytochrome c : Theoretical investigation of VER rates and pathways	Using a time-dependent perturbation theory , vibrational energy relaxation ( VER ) of isotopically labeled amide I modes in cytochrome c solvated with water is investigated . Contributions to the VER are decomposed into two contributions from the protein and water . The VER pathways are visualized using radial and angular excitation functions for resonant normal modes . Key differences of VER among different amide I modes are demonstrated , leading to a detailed picture of the spatial anisotropy of the VER . The results support the experimental observation that amide I modes in proteins relax with sub picosecond timescales , while the relaxation mechanism turns out to be sensitive to the environment of the amide I mode .
0707.2376	q-bio.PE cs.CE cs.DM	Tripartitions do not always discriminate phylogenetic networks	Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that allow for the representation of non-treelike evolutionary events , like recombination , hybridization , or lateral gene transfer . In a recent series of papers devoted to the study of reconstructibility of phylogenetic networks , Moret , Nakhleh , Warnow and collaborators introduced the so-called { tripartition metric for phylogenetic networks . In this paper we show that , in fact , this tripartition metric does not satisfy the separation axiom of distances ( zero distance means isomorphism , or , in a more relaxed version , zero distance means indistinguishability in some specific sense ) in any of the subclasses of phylogenetic networks where it is claimed to do so . We also present a subclass of phylogenetic networks whose members can be singled out by means of their sets of tripartitions ( or even clusters ) , and hence where the latter can be used to define a meaningful metric .
