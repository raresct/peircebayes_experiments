0709.3049	q-bio.PE	Epidemic Size in the Sis Model of Endemic Infec- Tions	We study the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model of the spread of an endemic infection . We calculate an exact expression for the mean number of transmissions for all values of the population and the infectivity . We derive the large-N asymptotic behavior for the infectivitiy below , above , and in the critical region . We obtain an analytical expression for the probability distribution of the number of transmissions , n , in the critical region . We show that this distribution has a $ n^3/2 $ singularity for small n and decays exponentially for large n. The exponent decreases with the distance from threshold , diverging to infinity far below and approaching zero far above .
