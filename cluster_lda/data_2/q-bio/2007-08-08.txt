0708.1136	q-bio.BM	Spatial effects on the speed and reliability of protein-DNA search	Strong experimental and theoretical evidence shows that transcription factors and other specific DNA-binding proteins find their sites using a two-mode search : alternating between 3D diffusion through the cell and 1D sliding along the DNA . We consider the role spatial effects in the mechanism on two different scales . First , we reconcile recent experimental findings by showing that the 3D diffusion of the transcription factor is often local , i.e . the transcription factor lands quite near its dissociation site . Second , we discriminate between two types of searches : global searches and local searches . We show that these searches differ significantly in average search time and the variability of search time . Using experimentally measured parameter values , we also show that 1D and 3D search is not optimally balanced , leading to much larger estimates of search time . Together , these results lead to a number of biological implications including suggestions of how prokaryotes and eukaryotes achieve rapid gene regulation and the relationship between the search mechanism and noise in gene expression .
0708.1173	q-bio.CB	A Map-Based Model of the Cardiac Action Potential	A discrete time model that is capable of replicating the basic features of cardiac cell action potentials is suggested . The paper shows how the map-based approaches can be used to design highly efficient computational models ( algorithms ) that enable large-scale simulations and analysis of discrete network models of cardiac activity .
