It is generally agreed that complexity has increased in our universe , giving way to life , multi-cellularity , societies , and systems of higher complexities . However , the mechanisms behind the complexification and its relation to evolution are not well understood . Moreover complexification can be used to mean different things in different contexts . For example , complexification has been interpreted as a process of diversification between evolving units [ 2 ] or as a scaling process related to the idea of transitions between different levels of complexity [ 7 ] . Understanding the difference or overlap between the mechanisms involved in both situations is mandatory to create acceptable synthetic models of the process , as is required in Artificial Life research .
