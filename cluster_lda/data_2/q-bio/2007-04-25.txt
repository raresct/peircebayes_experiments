0704.3321	q-bio.MN	A generic mechanism for adaptive growth rate regulation	How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions despite there exists a limited number of signal transduction machineries ? We show that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochastic fluctuations , adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise , even without specific signal transduction network for it . In general , changes in protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and degradation , both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth . In an adaptive state with a higher growth speed , both terms are large and balanced . Under the presence of noise in gene expression , the adaptive state is less affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are large , while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells are easily kicked out of the original state by noise . Hence , escape time from a cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated . This leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates , and model simulations confirm this selection to take place in general . The results suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - a process that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation . The present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses including the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth .
