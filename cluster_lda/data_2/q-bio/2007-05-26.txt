At its core is a system for acquiring , processing and communicating information that is universal , from viruses and bacteria to human beings . Advances in genetics and experience in designing computers have taken us to a stage where we can understand the optimisation principles at the root of this system , from the availability of basic building blocks to the execution of tasks . The languages of DNA and proteins are argued to be the optimal solutions to the information processing tasks they carry out . The analysis also suggests simpler predecessors to these languages , and provides fascinating clues about their origin . Obviously , a comprehensive unraveling of the puzzle of life would have a lot to say about what we may design or convert ourselves into .
