0709.2420	q-bio.PE	Gamete recognition and complementary haplotypes in sexual Penna ageing model	In simulations of sexual reproduction with diploid individuals , we introduce that female haploid gametes recognize one specific allele of the genomes as a marker of the male haploid gametes . They fuse to zygotes preferrably with male gametes having a different marker than their own . This gamete recognition enhances the advantage of complementary bit-strings in the simulated diploid individuals , at low recombination rates . Thus with rare recombinations the bit-string evolve to be complementary ; with recombination rate above about 0.1 instead they evolve under Darwinian purification selection , with few bits mutated .
