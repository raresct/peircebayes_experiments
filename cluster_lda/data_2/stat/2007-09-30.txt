0710.0178	stat.ME stat.AP	Quality assessment for short oligonucleotide microarray data	Quality of microarray gene expression data has emerged as a new research topic . As in other areas , microarray quality is assessed by comparing suitable numerical summaries across microarrays , so that outliers and trends can be visualized , and poor quality arrays or variable quality sets of arrays can be identified . Since each single array comprises tens or hundreds of thousands of measurements , the challenge is to find numerical summaries which can be used to make accurate quality calls . To this end , several new quality measures are introduced based on probe level and probeset level information , all obtained as a by-product of the low-level analysis algorithms RMA/fitPLM for Affymetrix GeneChips . Quality landscapes spatially localize chip or hybridization problems . Numerical chip quality measures are derived from the distributions of Normalized Unscaled Standard Errors and of Relative Log Expressions . Quality of chip batches is assessed by Residual Scale Factors . These quality assessment measures are demonstrated on a variety of datasets ( spike-in experiments , small lab experiments , multi-site studies ) . They are compared with Affymetrix's individual chip quality report .
