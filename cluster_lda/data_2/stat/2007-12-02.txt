By using large samples of independent and identically distributed realizations and statistical learning , it is possible to identify absence of fit through finding a classification rule that can efficiently identify single realizations of each type . The method requires a much wider range of descriptive statistics than are currently in use , and a new concept of model fitting which is derive from how physical laws are judged to fit data .
