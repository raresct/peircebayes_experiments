0707.4643	stat.ME stat.CO	Active Set and EM Algorithms for Log-Concave Densities Based on Complete and Censored Data	We develop an active set algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation of a log-concave density based on complete data . Building on this fast algorithm , we indidate an EM algorithm to treat arbitrarily censored or binned data .
