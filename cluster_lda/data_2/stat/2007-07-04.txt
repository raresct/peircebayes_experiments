0707.0600	stat.AP	Does heterosexual transmission drive the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa ( or elsewhere ) ?	A two-sex Basic Reproduction Number ( BRN ) is used to investigate the conditions under which the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) may spread through heterosexual contacts in Sub-Saharan Africa . ( The BRN is the expected number of new infections generated by one infected individual ; the disease spreads if the BRN is larger than 1 ) . A simple analytical expression for the BRN is derived on the basis of recent data on survival rates , transmission probabilities , and levels of sexual activity . Baseline results show that in the population at large ( characterized by equal numbers of men and women ) the BRN is larger than 1 if every year each person has 82 sexual contacts with different partners . the BRN is also larger than 1 for commercial sex workers ( CSWs ) and their clients ( two populations of different sizes ) if each CSW has about 256 clients per year and each client visits one CSW every two weeks . A sensitivity analysis explores the effect on the BRN of a doubling ( or a halving ) of the transmission probabilities . Implications and extensions are discussed .
