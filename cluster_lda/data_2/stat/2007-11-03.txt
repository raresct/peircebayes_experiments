0711.0458	stat.ME stat.CO	Bayesian finite mixtures : a note on prior specification and posterior computation	A new method for the computation of the posterior distribution of the number k of components in a finite mixture is presented . Two aspects of prior specification are also studied : an argument is made for the use of a Poisson ( 1 ) distribution as the prior for k ; and methods are given for the selection of hyperparameter values in the mixture of normals model , with natural conjugate priors on the components parameters .
