0711.0893	stat.AP physics.soc-ph	Application of information and complexity theories to public opinion polls . The case of Greece ( 2004-2007 )	A general methodology to study public opinion inspired from information and complexity theories is outlined . It is based on probabilistic data extracted from opinion polls . It gives a quantitative information-theoretic explanation of high job approval of Greek Prime Minister Mr. Constantinos Karamanlis ( 2004-2007 ) , while the same time series of polls conducted by the company Metron Analysis showed that his party New Democracy ( abbr . ND ) was slightly higher than the opposition party of PASOK -party leader Mr. George Papandreou . It is seen that the same mathematical model applies to the case of the popularity of President Clinton between January 1998 and February 1999 , according to a previous study , although the present work extends the investigation to concepts as complexity and Fisher information , quantifying the organization of public opinion data .
