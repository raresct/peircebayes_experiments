0707.3536	stat.ML	Degenerating families of dendrograms	Dendrograms used in data analysis are ultrametric spaces , hence objects of nonarchimedean geometry . It is known that there exist $ p $ -adic representation of dendrograms . Completed by a point at infinity , they can be viewed as subtrees of the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the $ p $ -adic projective line . The implications are that certain moduli spaces known in algebraic geometry are $ p $ -adic parameter spaces of ( families of ) dendrograms , and stochastic classification can also be handled within this framework . At the end , we calculate the topology of the hidden part of a dendrogram .
