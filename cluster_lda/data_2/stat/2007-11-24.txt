0711.3857	stat.ME	Periodic Chandrasekhar recursions	This paper extends the Chandrasekhar-type recursions due to Morf , Sidhu , and Kailath `` Some new algorithms for recursive estimation in constant , linear , discrete-time systems , IEEE Trans . Autom . Control 19 ( 1974 ) 315-323 '' to the case of periodic time-varying state-space models . We show that the S-lagged increments of the one-step prediction error covariance satisfy certain recursions from which we derive some algorithms for linear least squares estimation for periodic state-space models . The proposed recursions may have potential computational advantages over the Kalman Filter and , in particular , the periodic Riccati difference equation .
