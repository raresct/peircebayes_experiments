This system makes use of a neural network and a feedback control approach . It was found that by controlling the four controllable inputs : Democracy , Dependency , Allies and Capability simultaneously , all the predicted dispute outcomes could be avoided . Furthermore , it was observed that controlling a single input Dependency or Capability also avoids all the predicted conflicts . When the influence of each input variable on conflict is assessed , Dependency , Capability , and Democracy emerge as key variables that influence conflict .
