0706.2912	stat.ME	Statistical testing procedure for the interaction effects of several controllable factors in two-valued input-output systems	Suppose several two-valued input-output systems are designed by setting the levels of several controllable factors . For this situation , Taguchi method has proposed to assign the controllable factors to the orthogonal array and use ANOVA model for the standardized SN ratio , which is a natural measure for evaluating the performance of each input-output system . Though this procedure is simple and useful in application indeed , the result can be unreliable when the estimated standard errors of the standardized SN ratios are unbalanced . In this paper , we treat the data arising from the full factorial or fractional factorial designs of several controllable factors as the frequencies of high-dimensional contingency tables , and propose a general testing procedure for the main effects or the interaction effects of the controllable factors .
