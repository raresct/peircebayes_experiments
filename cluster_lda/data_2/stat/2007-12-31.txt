If the quality of an analytical method is doubtful , then the whole set of decision that will be based on those measures is questionable . For those reasons , being able to assess the quality of an analytical method is far more than a statistical challenge ; it 's a matter of ethic and good business practices . Many regulatory documents have been releases , primarily ICH and FDA documents in the pharmaceutical industry ( FDA , 1995 , 1997 , 2001 ) to address that issue .
