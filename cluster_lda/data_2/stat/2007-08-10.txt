0708.1401	stat.AP	Data selection and confounding in the court case of Lucia de Berk	The nurse Lucia de Berk was convicted by the Dutch courts as a serial killer with 7 murders and 3 attempts at murder in three hospitals where she worked . The nurse however always professed her innocence and indeed was never observed in such an act of murder . The courts based their decision on circumstantial evidence and upon the use of statistics . In the appeal court , the use of statistical calculations was repealed but the use of `` data '' and `` statistical insights '' were not excluded . The trial hinged importantly on the role of statistics and data gathering . It appears that data selection and confounding feature strongly in this case . The notion of `` nominal correlation '' can be used to highlight those two features . This suggests a mistrial with the conviction of an innocent person .
0708.1485	stat.CO math.OC	Pathwise coordinate optimization	We consider `` one-at-a-time '' coordinate-wise descent algorithms for a class of convex optimization problems . An algorithm of this kind has been proposed for the $ L_1 $ -penalized regression ( lasso ) in the literature , but it seems to have been largely ignored . Indeed , it seems that coordinate-wise algorithms are not often used in convex optimization . We show that this algorithm is very competitive with the well-known LARS ( or homotopy ) procedure in large lasso problems , and that it can be applied to related methods such as the garotte and elastic net . It turns out that coordinate-wise descent does not work in the `` fused lasso , '' however , so we derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a standard convex optimizer . Finally , we generalize the procedure to the two-dimensional fused lasso , and demonstrate its performance on some image smoothing problems .
