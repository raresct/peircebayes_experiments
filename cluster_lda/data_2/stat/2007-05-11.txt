0705.1598	stat.ME stat.CO	Application of Girsanov Theorem to Particle Filtering of Discretely Observed Continuous-Time Non-Linear Systems	This article considers the application of particle filtering to continuous-discrete optimal filtering problems , where the system model is a stochastic differential equation , and noisy measurements of the system are obtained at discrete instances of time . It is shown how the Girsanov theorem can be used for evaluating the likelihood ratios needed in importance sampling . It is also shown how the methodology can be applied to a class of models , where the driving noise process is lower in the dimensionality than the state and thus the laws of state and noise are not absolutely continuous . Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally Gaussian models and unknown static parameter models is also considered .
