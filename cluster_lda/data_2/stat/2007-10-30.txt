0710.5670	stat.CO	An Elegant Method for Generating Multivariate Poisson Random Variable	Generating multivariate Poisson data is essential in many applications . Current simulation methods suffer from limitations ranging from computational complexity to restrictions on the structure of the correlation matrix . We propose a computationally efficient and conceptually appealing method for generating multivariate Poisson data . The method is based on simulating multivariate Normal data and converting them to achieve a specific correlation matrix and Poisson rate vector . This allows for generating data that have positive or negative correlations as well as different rates .

We establish conditional asymptotic normality of the regression coefficient estimators under regularity conditions , and formally justify the approach of plugging in kernel-type density estimators in conditional inference procedures . Simulation results show that the approach yields accurate conditional coverage probabilities when used for constructing confidence intervals . The plug-in approach can be applied in conjunction with configural polysampling to derive robust conditional estimators adaptive to a confrontation of contrasting scenarios . We demonstrate this by investigating the conditional mean squared error of location estimators under various confrontations in a simulation study , which successfully extends configural polysampling to a nonparametric context .
