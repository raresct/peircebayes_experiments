Markov Chain modelling is a simple stochastic process model that has found its application in both describing stochastic evolution of system and in system reliability estimation . The recent developments in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the possible integration of Bayesian theory within Markov Chain theory have enhanced its application possibilities . However , the application possibility can be furthered to range over wider scales of application ( perhaps from nano- to macro- ) by considering the developments in Physics ( in particular Quantum Physics ) . This paper tries to present the results of quantum physics that would help in interpretation of transition probability matrix . However , care has to be taken in the choice of densities in computing the transition probability matrix . The paper is based on available literature , and the aim is only to make an attempt to show how Markov Chain can be used to model systems at various scales .
