0706.1401	stat.AP	Controlling for individual heterogeneity in longitudinal models , with applications to student achievement	Longitudinal data tracking repeated measurements on individuals are highly valued for research because they offer controls for unmeasured individual heterogeneity that might otherwise bias results . Random effects or mixed models approaches , which treat individual heterogeneity as part of the model error term and use generalized least squares to estimate model parameters , are often criticized because correlation between unobserved individual effects and other model variables can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates . Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model , this article demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has a `` bias compression '' property under a general model for individual heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among individuals . The general model is motivated by the complexities of longitudinal student achievement measures , but the results have broad applicability to longitudinal modeling .
0706.1408	stat.ME	Sensitivity of principal Hessian direction analysis	We provide sensitivity comparisons for two competing versions of the dimension reduction method principal Hessian directions ( pHd ) . These comparisons consider the effects of small perturbations on the estimation of the dimension reduction subspace via the influence function . We show that the two versions of pHd can behave completely differently in the presence of certain observational types . Our results also provide evidence that outliers in the traditional sense may or may not be highly influential in practice . Since influential observations may lurk within otherwise typical data , we consider the influence function in the empirical setting for the efficient detection of influential observations in practice .
