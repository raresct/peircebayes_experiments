0711.3035	stat.ME stat.AP	Statistical Inference for Disordered Sphere Packings	Sphere packings are essential to the development of physical models for powders , composite materials , and the atomic structure of the liquid state . There is a strong scientific need to be able to assess the fit of packing models to data , but this is complicated by the lack of formal probabilistic models for packings . Without formal models , simulation algorithms and collections of physical objects must be used as models . Identification of common aspects of different realizations of the same packing process requires the use of new descriptive statistics , many of which have yet to be developed . Model assessment will require the use of large samples of independent and identically distributed realizations , rather than the large single stationary realizations found in conventional spatial statistics . The development of procedures for model assessment will resemble the development of thermodynamic models , and will be based on much exploration and experimentation rather than on extensions of established statistical methods .
