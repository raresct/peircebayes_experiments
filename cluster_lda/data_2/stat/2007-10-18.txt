In this paper we use a Bayesian dynamic generalised linear model ( DGLM ) to estimate this relationship , which allows the standard linear or additive model to be extended in two ways : ( i ) the long-term trend and temporal correlation present in the health data can be modelled by an autoregressive process rather than a smooth function of calendar time ; ( ii ) the effects of air pollution are allowed to evolve over time . The efficacy of these two extensions are investigated by applying a series of dynamic and non-dynamic models to air pollution and mortality data from Greater London . A Bayesian approach is taken throughout , and a Markov chain monte carlo simulation algorithm is presented for inference . An alternative likelihood based analysis is also presented , in order to allow a direct comparison with the only previous analysis of air pollution and health data using a DGLM .
