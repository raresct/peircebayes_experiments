0706.4190	stat.ME	SiZer for time series : A new approach to the analysis of trends	Smoothing methods and SiZer are a useful statistical tool for discovering statistically significant structure in data . Based on scale space ideas originally developed in the computer vision literature , SiZer ( SIgnificant ZERo crossing of the derivatives ) is a graphical device to assess which observed features are `really there ' and which are just spurious sampling artifacts . In this paper , we develop SiZer like ideas in time series analysis to address the important issue of significance of trends . This is not a straightforward extension , since one data set does not contain the information needed to distinguish `trend ' from `dependence ' . A new visualization is proposed , which shows the statistician the range of trade-offs that are available . Simulation and real data results illustrate the effectiveness of the method .
