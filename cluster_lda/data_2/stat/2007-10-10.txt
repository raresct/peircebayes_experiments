0710.2024	stat.AP stat.ME	Ratios : A short guide to confidence limits and proper use	Researchers often calculate ratios of measured quantities . Specifying confidence limits for ratios is difficult and the appropriate methods are often unknown . Appropriate methods are described ( Fieller , Taylor , special bootstrap methods ) . For the Fieller method a simple geometrical interpretation is given . Monte Carlo simulations show when these methods are appropriate and that the most frequently used methods ( index method and zero-variance method ) can lead to large liberal deviations from the desired confidence level . It is discussed when we can use standard regression or measurement error models and when we have to resort to specific models for heteroscedastic data . Finally , an old warning is repeated that we should be aware of the problems of spurious correlations if we use ratios .
