0707.4072	stat.ML	Families of dendrograms	A conceptual framework for cluster analysis from the viewpoint of p-adic geometry is introduced by describing the space of all dendrograms for n datapoints and relating it to the moduli space of p-adic Riemannian spheres with punctures using a method recently applied by Murtagh ( 2004b ) . This method embeds a dendrogram as a subtree into the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the p-adic numbers , and goes back to Cornelissen et al . ( 2001 ) in p-adic geometry . After explaining the definitions , the concept of classifiers is discussed in the context of moduli spaces , and upper bounds for the number of hidden vertices in dendrograms are given .
