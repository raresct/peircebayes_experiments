The proposed procedure combines the sample and prior information , and selects significant variables for responses in a narrower region where the true parameters lie . It increases the efficiency to choose the true model correctly . The proposed procedure can be executed by many constrained quadratic programming methods and the initial estimator can be found by least square or Monte Carlo method . The proposed procedure also enjoys good theoretical properties . Moreover , the proposed procedure is not only used for linear models but also can be used for generalized linear models ( { \sl GLM } ) , Cox models , quantile regression models and many others with the help of Wang and Leng ( 2007 ) 's LSA , which changes these models as the approximation of linear models . The idea of combining sample and prior constraint information can be also used for other modified lasso procedures . Some examples are used for illustration of the idea of incorporating prior constraint information in variable selection procedures .
