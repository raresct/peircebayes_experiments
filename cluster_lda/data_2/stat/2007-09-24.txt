0709.3560	stat.CO	On The Density Estimation by Super-Parametric Method	The super-parametric density estimators and its related algorism were suggested by Y . -S. Tsai et al [ 7 ] . The number of parameters is unlimited in the super- parametric estimators and it is a general theory in sense of unifying or connecting nonparametric and parametric estimators . Before applying to numerical examples , we can not give any comment of the estimators . In this paper , we will focus on the implementation , the computer programming , of the algorism and strategies of choosing window functions . B-splines , Bezier splines and covering windows are studied as well . According to the criterion of the convergence conditions for Parzen window , the number of the window functions shall be , roughly , proportional to the number of samples and so is the number of the variables . Since the algorism is designed for solving the optimization of likelihood function , there will be a set of nonlinear equations with a large number of variables . The results show that algorism suggested by Y . -S. Tsai is very powerful and effective in the sense of mathematics , that is , the iteration procedures converge and the rates of convergence are very fast . Also , the numerical results of different window functions show that the approach of super-parametric density estimators has ushered a new era of statistics .
