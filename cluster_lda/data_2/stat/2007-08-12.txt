0708.1627	stat.ME	Rearranging Edgeworth-Cornish-Fisher Expansions	This paper applies a regularization procedure called increasing rearrangement to monotonize Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions and any other related approximations of distribution and quantile functions of sample statistics . Besides satisfying the logical monotonicity , required of distribution and quantile functions , the procedure often delivers strikingly better approximations to the distribution and quantile functions of the sample mean than the original Edgeworth-Cornish-Fisher expansions .
