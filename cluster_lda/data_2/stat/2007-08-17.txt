0708.2377	stat.ML	Online Learning in Discrete Hidden Markov Models	We present and analyse three online algorithms for learning in discrete Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) and compare them with the Baldi-Chauvin Algorithm . Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of generalisation error we draw learning curves in simplified situations . The performance for learning drifting concepts of one of the presented algorithms is analysed and compared with the Baldi-Chauvin algorithm in the same situations . A brief discussion about learning and symmetry breaking based on our results is also presented .
