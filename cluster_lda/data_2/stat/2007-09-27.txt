0709.4323	stat.ME	Markov basis for design of experiments with three-level factors	We consider Markov basis arising from fractional factorial designs with three-level factors . Once we have a Markov basis , $ p $ values for various conditional tests are estimated by the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure . For designed experiments with a single count observation for each run , we formulate a generalized linear model and consider a sample space with the same sufficient statistics to the observed data . Each model is characterized by a covariate matrix , which is constructed from the main and the interaction effects we intend to measure . We investigate fractional factorial designs with $ 3^ { p-q } $ runs noting correspondences to the models for $ 3^ { p-q } $ contingency tables .
