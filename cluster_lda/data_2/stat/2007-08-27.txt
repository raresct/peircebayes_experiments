0708.3545	stat.AP	Applied statistics : A review	The main phases of applied statistical work are discussed in general terms . The account starts with the clarification of objectives and proceeds through study design , measurement and analysis to interpretation . An attempt is made to extract some general notions .
0708.3601	stat.AP	A correlated topic model of Science	Topic models , such as latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) , can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data . The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics , each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary . A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though , for example , a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy . This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions . In this paper we develop the correlated topic model ( CTM ) , where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [ J. Roy . Statist . Soc . Ser . B 44 ( 1982 ) 139 -- 177 ] . We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model , which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial . We apply the CTM to the articles from Science published from 1990 -- 1999 , a data set that comprises 57M words . The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA , and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections .
