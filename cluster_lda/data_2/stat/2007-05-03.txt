0705.0418	stat.AP stat.ME	Various Approaches for Predicting Land Cover in Mountain Areas	Using former maps , geographers intend to study the evolution of the land cover in order to have a prospective approach on the future landscape ; predictions of the future land cover , by the use of older maps and environmental variables , are usually done through the GIS ( Geographic Information System ) . We propose here to confront this classical geographical approach with statistical approaches : a linear parametric model ( polychotomous regression modeling ) and a nonparametric one ( multilayer perceptron ) . These methodologies have been tested on two real areas on which the land cover is known at various dates ; this allows us to emphasize the benefit of these two statistical approaches compared to GIS and to discuss the way GIS could be improved by the use of statistical models .
