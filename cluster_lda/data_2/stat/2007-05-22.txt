0705.3257	stat.AP	Evaluating Throwing Ability in Baseball	We present a quantitative analysis of throwing ability for major league outfielders and catchers . We use detailed game event data to tabulate success and failure events in outfielder and catcher throwing opportunities . We attribute a run contribution to each success or failure which are tabulated for each player in each season . We use four seasons of data to estimate the overall throwing ability of each player using a Bayesian hierarchical model . This model allows us to shrink individual player estimates towards an overall population mean depending on the number of opportunities for each player . We use the posterior distribution of player abilities from this model to identify players with significant positive and negative throwing contributions .
