The challenge is that the dimension of $ \mathbf { X } $ is much larger than that of $ \mathbf { Y } $ and thus the problem is often called ill-posed . This paper studies some statistical aspects of network tomography . We first address the identifiability issue and prove that the $ \mathbf { X } $ distribution is identifiable up to a shift parameter under mild conditions . We then use a mixture model of characteristic functions to derive a fast algorithm for estimating the distribution of $ \mathbf { X } $ based on the General method of Moments . Through extensive model simulation and real Internet trace driven simulation , the proposed approach is shown to be favorable comparing to previous methods using simple discretization for inferring link delays in a heterogeneous network .
