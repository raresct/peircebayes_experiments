That model , which is developed within an Bayesian hierarchical framework , inherits the important feature of such models that its coefficients , treated as states of the process , can change with time . Thus the model includes a time -- varying site invariant mean field as well as time varying coefficients for 24 and 12 diurnal cycle components . This cost of this model 's great flexibility comes at the cost of computational complexity , forcing us to use an MCMC approach and to restrict application of our model domain to a small number of monitoring sites . We critically assess this model and discover some of its weaknesses in this type of application .

Robust SVD , regression and location-scale	Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) is the basic body of many statistical algorithms and few users question whether SVD is properly handling its job . SVD aims at evaluating the decomposition that best approximates a data matrix , given some rank restriction . However often we are interested in the best components of the decomposition rather than in the best approximation . This conflict of objectives leads us to introduce { \em Total SVD } , where the word `` Total '' is taken as in `` Total '' least squares . SVD is a least squares method and , therefore , is very sensitive to gross errors in the data matrix . We make SVD robust by imposing a weight to each of the matrix entries . Breakdown properties are excellent . Algorithmic aspects are handled ; they rely on high dimension fixed point computations .
