0706.1287	stat.ME	Bayesian Covariance Matrix Estimation using a Mixture of Decomposable Graphical Models	A Bayesian approach is used to estimate the covariance matrix of Gaussian data . Ideas from Gaussian graphical models and model selection are used to construct a prior for the covariance matrix that is a mixture over all decomposable graphs . For this prior the probability of each graph size is specified by the user and graphs of equal size are assigned equal probability . Most previous approaches assume that all graphs are equally probable . We show empirically that the prior that assigns equal probability over graph sizes outperforms the prior that assigns equal probability over all graphs , both in identifying the correct decomposable graph and in more efficiently estimating the covariance matrix .
