0706.3434	stat.ML stat.AP	Separating populations with wide data : A spectral analysis	In this paper , we consider the problem of partitioning a small data sample drawn from a mixture of $ k $ product distributions . We are interested in the case that individual features are of low average quality $ \gamma $ , and we want to use as few of them as possible to correctly partition the sample . We analyze a spectral technique that is able to approximately optimize the total data size -- the product of number of data points $ n $ and the number of features $ K $ -- needed to correctly perform this partitioning as a function of $ 1/\gamma $ for $ K > n $ . Our goal is motivated by an application in clustering individuals according to their population of origin using markers , when the divergence between any two of the populations is small .
