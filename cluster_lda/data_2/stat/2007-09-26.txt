The two preeminent inference methods are the MaxEnt method , which uses information in the form of constraints and Bayes ' rule which uses information in the form of data . It has been shown that these two methods are special cases of the method of Maximum ( relative ) Entropy ( ME ) . We demonstrate how this method can be used as a measure of diversity that not only reproduces the features of Shannon 's index but exceeds them by allowing more types of information to be included in the inference . A specific example is solved in detail . Additionally , the entropy that is found is the same form as the thermodynamic entropy .

In this paper we describe an SSA ( Singular Spectrum Analysis ) based approach in order to decompose the time-series of particulate matter concentration into a set of exposure variables , each one representing a different timescale . We implement our methodology to investigate both acute and long-term effects of $ PM_ { 10 } $ exposure on morbidity from respiratory causes within the urban area of Bari , Italy .
