We have derived the expression of the reliability of a system using the Markovian model for the transfer of control between modules in order . We have given the expression of reliability by considering both benign and catastrophic failure . The expression of reliability presented in this work is applicable for some control software which are designed to detect its own internal errors .
0710.2912	stat.ME stat.CO	Updating Probabilities : An Econometric Example	We demonstrate how information in the form of observable data and moment constraints are introduced into the method of Maximum relative Entropy ( ME ) . A general example of updating with data and moments is shown . A specific econometric example is solved in detail which can then be used as a template for real world problems . A numerical example is compared to a large deviation solution which illustrates some of the advantages of the ME method .
