0712.0974	stat.AP	Editorial : Statistics and forensic science	Forensic science is usually taken to mean the application of a broad spectrum of scientific tools to answer questions of interest to the legal system . Despite such popular television series as CSI : Crime Scene Investigation and its spinoffs -- CSI : Miami and CSI : New York -- on which the forensic scientists use the latest high-tech scientific tools to identify the perpetrator of a crime and always in under an hour , forensic science is under assault , in the public media , popular magazines [ Talbot ( 2007 ) , Toobin ( 2007 ) ] and in the scientific literature [ Kennedy ( 2003 ) , Saks and Koehler ( 2005 ) ] . Ironically , this growing controversy over forensic science has occurred precisely at the time that DNA evidence has become the `` gold standard '' in the courts , leading to the overturning of hundreds of convictions many of which were based on clearly less credible forensic evidence , including eyewitness testimony [ Berger ( 2006 ) ] .

Much of this new research falls into one of two broad categories : kernel methods and ensemble methods . In this expository article , I discuss the main ideas behind these two types of methods , namely how to transform linear algorithms into nonlinear ones by using kernel functions , and how to make predictions with an ensemble or a collection of models rather than a single model . I also share my personal perspectives on how these ideas have influenced and shaped my own research . In particular , I present two recent algorithms that I have invented with my collaborators : LAGO , a fast kernel algorithm for unbalanced classification and rare target detection ; and Darwinian evolution in parallel universes , an ensemble method for variable selection .
