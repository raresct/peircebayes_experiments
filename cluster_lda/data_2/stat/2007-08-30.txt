0708.4131	stat.ME	Full Bayesian analysis for a class of jump-diffusion models	A new Bayesian significance test is adjusted for jump detection in a diffusion process . This is an advantageous procedure for temporal data having extreme valued outliers , like financial data , pluvial or tectonic forces records and others .
0708.4152	stat.CO math.ST stat.TH	Estimation in hidden Markov models via efficient importance sampling	Given a sequence of observations from a discrete-time , finite-state hidden Markov model , we would like to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic . The bootstrap method is employed to approximate the confidence regions of a multi-dimensional parameter . We propose an importance sampling formula for efficient simulation in this context . Our approach consists of constructing a locally asymptotically normal ( LAN ) family of probability distributions around the default resampling rule and then minimizing the asymptotic variance within the LAN family . The solution of this minimization problem characterizes the asymptotically optimal resampling scheme , which is given by a tilting formula . The implementation of the tilting formula is facilitated by solving a Poisson equation . A few numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed importance sampling scheme .
