0707.2257	stat.ME	A Bayes method for a Bathtub Failure Rate via two $ \mathbf { S } $ -paths	A class of semi-parametric hazard/failure rates with a bathtub shape is of interest . It does not only provide a great deal of flexibility over existing parametric methods in the modeling aspect but also results in a closed and tractable Bayes estimator for the bathtub-shaped failure rate ( BFR ) . Such an estimator is derived to be a finite sum over two $ \mathbf { S } $ -paths due to an explicit posterior analysis in terms of two ( conditionally independent ) $ \mathbf { S } $ -paths . These , newly discovered , explicit results can be proved to be a Rao-Blackwellization of counterpart results in terms of partitions that are readily available by a specialization of James ( 2005 ) 's work . We develop both iterative and non-iterative computational procedures based on existing efficient Monte Carlo methods for sampling one single $ \mathbf { S } $ -path . Nmerical simulations are given to demonstrate the practicality and the effectiveness of our methodology . Last but not least , two applications of the proposed method are discussed , of which one is about a Bayesian test for failure rates and the other is related to modeling with covariates .
