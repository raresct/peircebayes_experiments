0709.3192	stat.ME math.ST stat.TH	A quantile-copula approach to conditional density estimation	We present a new non-parametric estimator of the conditional density of the kernel type . It is based on an efficient transformation of the data by quantile transform . By use of the copula representation , it turns out to have a remarkable product form . We study its asymptotic properties and compare its bias and variance to competitors based on nonparametric regression .
