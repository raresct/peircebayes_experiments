0712.1342	stat.ME	Stochastic adaptation of importance sampler	Improving efficiency of importance sampler is at the center of research in Monte Carlo methods . While adaptive approach is usually difficult within the Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework , the counterpart in importance sampling can be justified and validated easily . We propose an iterative adaptation method for learning the proposal distribution of an importance sampler based on stochastic approximation . The stochastic approximation method can recruit general iterative optimization techniques like the minorization-maximization algorithm . The effectiveness of the approach in optimizing the Kullback divergence between the proposal distribution and the target is demonstrated using several simple examples .
0712.1425	stat.AP	Curve alignment by moments	A significant problem with most functional data analyses is that of misaligned curves . Without adjustment , even an analysis as simple as estimation of the mean will fail . One common method to synchronize a set of curves involves equating `` landmarks '' such as peaks or troughs . The landmarks method can work well but will fail if marker events can not be identified or are missing from some curves . An alternative approach , the `` continuous monotone registration '' method , works by transforming the curves so that they are as close as possible to a target function . This method can also perform well but is highly dependent on identifying an accurate target function . We develop an alignment method based on equating the `` moments '' of a given set of curves . These moments are intended to capture the locations of important features which may represent local behavior , such as maximums and minimums , or more global characteristics , such as the slope of the curve averaged over time . Our method works by equating the moments of the curves while also shrinking toward a common shape . This allows us to capture the advantages of both the landmark and continuous monotone registration approaches . The method is illustrated on several data sets and a simulation study is performed .
0712.1458	stat.AP	Accounting for spatial correlation in the scan statistic	The spatial scan statistic is widely used in epidemiology and medical studies as a tool to identify hotspots of diseases . The classical spatial scan statistic assumes the number of disease cases in different locations have independent Poisson distributions , while in practice the data may exhibit overdispersion and spatial correlation . In this work , we examine the behavior of the spatial scan statistic when overdispersion and spatial correlation are present , and propose a modified spatial scan statistic to account for that . Some theoretical results are provided to demonstrate that ignoring the overdispersion and spatial correlation leads to an increased rate of false positives , which is verified through a simulation study . Simulation studies also show that our modified procedure can substantially reduce the rate of false alarms . Two data examples involving brain cancer cases in New Mexico and chickenpox incidence data in France are used to illustrate the practical relevance of the modified procedure .
0712.1477	stat.AP	Crossing paths in 2D Random Walks	We investigate crossing path probabilities for two agents that move randomly in a bounded region of the plane or on a sphere ( denoted $ R $ ) . At each discrete time-step the agents move , independently , fixed distances $ d_1 $ and $ d_2 $ at angles that are uniformly distributed in $ ( 0,2\pi ) $ . If $ R $ is large enough and the initial positions of the agents are uniformly distributed in $ R $ , then the probability of paths crossing at the first time-step is close to $ 2d_1d_2/ ( \pi A [ R ] ) $ , where $ A [ R ] $ is the area of $ R $ . Simulations suggest that the long-run rate at which paths cross is also close to $ 2d_1d_2/ ( \pi A [ R ] ) $ ( despite marked departures from uniformity and independence conditions needed for such a conclusion ) .
