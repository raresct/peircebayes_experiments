0709.1307	stat.AP	MOST : detecting cancer differential gene expression	We propose a new statistics for the detection of differentially expressed genes , when the genes are activated only in a subset of the samples . Statistics designed for this unconventional circumstance has proved to be valuable for most cancer studies , where oncogenes are activated for a small number of disease samples . Previous efforts made in this direction include COPA , OS and ORT . We propose a new statistics called maximum ordered subset t-statistics ( MOST ) which seems to be natural when the number of activated samples is unknown . We compare MOST to other statistics and find the proposed method often has more power then its competitors .
0709.1309	stat.CO stat.ME	Bayes and empirical Bayes changepoint problems	We generalize the approach of Liu and Lawrence ( 1999 ) for multiple changepoint problems where the number of changepoints is unknown . The approach is based on dynamic programming recursion for efficient calculation of the marginal probability of the data with the hidden parameters integrated out . For the estimation of the hyperparameters , we propose to use Monte Carlo EM when training data are available . We argue that there is some advantages of using samples from the posterior which takes into account the uncertainty of the changepoints , compared to the traditional MAP estimator , which is also more expensive to compute in this context . The samples from the posterior obtained by our algorithm are independent , getting rid of the convergence issue associated with the MCMC approach . We illustrate our approach on limited simulations and some real data set .
