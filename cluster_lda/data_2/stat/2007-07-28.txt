0707.4242	stat.CO stat.AP	Importance Tempering	Simulated tempering ( ST ) is an established Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) method for sampling from a multimodal density $ \pi ( \theta ) $ . Typically , ST involves introducing an auxiliary variable $ k $ taking values in a finite subset of $ [ 0,1 ] $ and indexing a set of tempered distributions , say $ \pi_k ( \theta ) \propto \pi ( \theta ) ^k $ . In this case , small values of $ k $ encourage better mixing , but samples from $ \pi $ are only obtained when the joint chain for $ ( \theta , k ) $ reaches $ k=1 $ . However , the entire chain can be used to estimate expectations under $ \pi $ of functions of interest , provided that importance sampling ( IS ) weights are calculated . Unfortunately this method , which we call importance tempering ( IT ) , can disappoint . This is partly because the most immediately obvious implementation is na\ '' ive and can lead to high variance estimators . We derive a new optimal method for combining multiple IS estimators and prove that the resulting estimator has a highly desirable property related to the notion of effective sample size . We briefly report on the success of the optimal combination in two modelling scenarios requiring reversible-jump MCMC , where the na\ '' ive approach fails .
