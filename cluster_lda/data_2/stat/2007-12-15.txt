When agents in discrete choice models are assumed to have differing preferences , exact inference is often intractable . Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques make approximate inference possible , but the computational cost is prohibitive on the large data sets now becoming routinely available . Variational methods provide a deterministic alternative for approximation of the posterior distribution . We derive variational procedures for empirical Bayes and fully Bayesian inference in the mixed multinomial logit model of discrete choice . The algorithms require only that we solve a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems , which are shown to be convex . Extensive simulations demonstrate that variational methods achieve accuracy competitive with Markov chain Monte Carlo , at a small fraction of the computational cost . Thus , variational methods permit inferences on data sets that otherwise could not be analyzed without bias-inducing modifications to the underlying model .
